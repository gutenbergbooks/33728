<p><span class="smcap">I wasn't</span> going to make no statement about
this here affair; and I wouldn't even yet, only
for our publicity man. The day the story
leaked he called me up in the A. M., which is
the B. C. of the daytime, and woke me out of
the first perfectly good sleep I'd had since Jim
pulled that stunt and floored me so.</p>

<p>First off, I wouldn't answer the phone; but
Musette stood by me with it in her hand and
just made me.</p>

<p>"For my sake, mademoiselle!" says she, just
like she used to in our act on the big time, which
we played before I got into the dancing game.
"For my sake, mademoiselle," she says, "do
not refuse to talk with the publicity man!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p><p>Well, when I heard who it was I seen some
sense in what she says; so I set up amid my
black-and-white-check bed, which&mdash;believe you
me&mdash;is as up to date as my latest drawing-room
dance. And I grabbed off the phone.</p>

<p>"Yes," says I in a fainting voice; "this is
Miss La Tour. What is it, please? I'm far
from well."</p>

<p>"Cut out that stuff, Mary!" says a male
voice. "This is Roscoe. I want you to give
out a statement about you and Jim splitting
up."</p>

<p>"I <i>won't!"</i> says I, very sharp. "Whatter
yer think I am?" I says. "That's nobody's
business but our own!"</p>

<p>"Oh, ain't it, though?" says Roscoe, very
sarcastic. "The biggest parlor-dancing outfit
in America busts up and you can't be seen,
even, for two whole days! The stage at the
Royal ain't notified that your piece is called
off; the De-Luxe Hotel don't get no notice
that you ain't going to appear; and all the info'
I could get when I called up your flat is that
you was gone out!"</p>

<p>"And so I was!" says I, indignant.</p>

<p>"Then I call up Jim's hotel and they say
he's gone!" shouted Roscoe. "Hell!" says he,
forgetting that me and the telephone operator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
both was ladies. "Hell! What kind of way
is that to treat a guy you're paying three thou.
a year to for getting your picture in the paper
every time you sneeze?"</p>

<p>I didn't have any comeback about that, for
there was certainly some truth in what he says.
But I wasn't to be put down so easy.</p>

<p>"I guess I know my business, Ros," I says,
sharp, "or I wouldn't be living in a swell flat
on the Drive, all fixed up like a furniture shop,
with a limousine and two fool dogs, and earned
every cent of it myself, and no one can say a
word against me, if I didn't know my own
business. So there!"</p>

<p>"Looka here, Mary," says Roscoe. "There's
going to be a lot of talk up and down the Rialto
if you don't come across with some explanation.
I'm comin' right up to get it."</p>

<p>"No, you don't," I says, for I hadn't had my
facial massage in three days, and, after all,
Roscoe is a man, even if press agents ain't exactly
human. "No, you don't, Ros!" I says.
"If I gotter make some statement, I'll write
the dope myself and you can fix it up after&mdash;see?
It's a big story, but delicate, and I'm
going to have no misunderstanding over it."</p>

<p>"All right, Mary," says Ros. "But you get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the stuff ready for the morning papers. I'll
be up for it."</p>

<p>Then he hung up and I knew I had to come
across. Besides, Ma come in just then; and
while I may boss my press agent, and even
sometimes my partner and Musette and the
two dogs, Ma sorter gets my goat. Ma had on
a elegant rose-silk negligee I give her; and as
usual, she had it ruined by tying a big gingham
apron over it, which made her look the size of
a house, but sort of comforting. She stopped
by the bed and set both her hands on her lips&mdash;the
way she does when she don't mean to
be answered back.</p>

<p>"Now, Mary Gilligan, you get right up and
wash your teeth!" says Ma, "and do your three
handsprings and other exercises, decent and
proper; and then eat the breakfast I got
cooked for you."</p>

<p>Funny thing, but Ma ain't got a mite of
dramatic sense. I just can't understand it,
after her having been with the circus so long
on the trapeze, until she got too heavy after
I come; and since then in the wardrobe-end of
the theater, and all. I ain't never been able
to break her in to none of the refinements of
life, either, and she will go into the kitchen for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
all I say; and some day I just know she'll call
me Gilligan in public. And a nice laugh
that'll get!</p>

<p>But, anyhow, I usually do what she says,
because Ma is a fine trainer; and&mdash;believe you
me&mdash;I wouldn't be able to hold on to Jim's
neck and swing out straight twenty times
round, like I do&mdash;or did&mdash;only for her and her
keeping me on the job like she's done. The
only other trouble with Ma is, she can't seem
to properly understand that it's my artistic
temperament which has brought in the cash&mdash;that
and some good looks, and me realizing
that this refined parlor-dancing stuff would go
over big. Of course Jim's being able to wear
a dress suit like he'd been born in it has helped
some, even aside from being such a fine partner;
which brings me back, as they say, to the
tale.</p>

<p>Well, I done my exercise, and so forth, and
then I had Musette bring up the sofa, a elegant
gilt one&mdash;for we got what Ma calls Looie-the-Head-Waiter
stuff in our parlor&mdash;to the
window, so's I could lay and look dreamily
out over the autos on the Drive to the ships
in the river; you know&mdash;the German ships
which have been taking out their naturalization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
papers, or something. And, as I lay there
thinking, I come to the conclusion that if I told
about the split I better tell all, including my
own enlistment.</p>

<p>Oh, how well I can now understand why
many men enlist, having been through it all
myself! And how then they long to get out,
and can't, and realize that they was boobs!
And how they learn that they weren't boobs
after all, once they got used to it! Do you
get me?</p>

<p>Well, anyways, I decided to tell the whole
story, which, of course, begun at Ruby Roselle's
party.</p>

<p>I think I don't hardly need to state that I
don't generally go with that Roselle crowd.
No acrobatic dancer could and keep her health.
And&mdash;believe you me&mdash;every drawing-room
dance act that is worth a thousand dollars a
week has acrobatics, and good sound acrobatics,
as its base. Well! As far as Ruby Roselle
and her crowd is concerned, far be it from
me to pass any remarks. But any one in the
theatrical line will tell you that a girl which
has made a reputation only on the color of her
hair and is not averse to tights don't have to
lead the rigid life of a first-class A-1 dancer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
leaving out all judgments as to character,
which are usually wrong anyways.</p>

<p>But, having said that much, I will only add
that I have never gone out a lot, and seldom
without Ma. And while champagne is not exactly
a stranger to me, owing to Jim and me
always having to have it served with our dinner
at the Ritz each night&mdash;which any one with
sense knows is all publicity stuff and we never
drink it&mdash;still, I'm not in favor of champagne
parties, which they generally end in trouble;
and this one of Ruby's was no exception.</p>

<p>Indeed, I wouldn't of gone in the first place
only for us unfortunately being on the same
bill at the opening of the Superba Roof, which,
of course, being the big midnight show of the
year, and the rest of the leads all having accepted,
and Ruby being in so strong with the
management, it would of been bad business
policy to refuse.</p>

<p>When I pointed this out to Jim he couldn't
see it at first, owing to me never having gone
on such parties; and nobody can say any different,
with truth. But the Superba contract
was the biggest thing we had got yet. And,
coming on top of the twenty minutes in Give
Us a Kiss, the twenty minutes at the De-Luxe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Hotel, the net profs. was pretty fair. So, for
once, we accepted an invite to one of Ruby's
famous blow-outs.</p>

<p>Ruby Roselle's house was something wonderful,
but not to my taste, there being too
much in it, besides smelling of cologne and incense,
which, from her singing Overseas in
red-white-and-blue tights, was more or less to
be expected. Also, the clothes on her and the
other girls was too elaborate. My simple little
real lace, and my hair, which Musette always
does so it looks like I done it myself,
made them seem like a Hippodrome production
alongside of a play by this foreigner, Ib-sen&mdash;do
you get me? I was proud of this;
for&mdash;believe you me&mdash;getting refinement
means work, just like any other achievement,
and I had modeled myself on Mrs. Pieter van
Norden for years, than whom there is surely
no one more refined by reputation, though I
had never seen her. I could see Jim felt the
same about all this, and we exchanged a look
on it; for, besides being engaged to be married
we was the best of friends when we come
in&mdash;when we come in! Remember that!</p>

<p>After we said "How do ye do?" to Ruby, I
whispered to Jim not to celebrate too much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
He ain't a drinking man if for no other reasons
but those of my own; but just oncet in a
while he'd get a little more than he should, and
this opening night the show had gone awful
big. Had he but heeded me better! Alas!
Nothing doing; it was all in vain!</p>

<p>For description of party see any motion-picture
film on Vice. Why waste words on
what is so well known? And&mdash;believe you me&mdash;this
was just like a fillum; and, as I have
said, nothing like that for mine, usually. But,
even so, we might of got off safe and home
without no trouble&mdash;only for Von Hoffman
and the baby alligator.</p>

<p>It seems like this here Von Hoffman was
stuck on Ruby; in fact, it was him that suggested
her singing Overseas in that fierce costume.
Also, he gave her the alligator, she having
tried to pick on a present he couldn't possibly
get when he wanted to buy her something.
But, being German by descent, he had
the efficiency to get it, anyways; and there was
the alligator at the party, about fifteen inches
long, with a gold collar and diamonds in the
collar&mdash;and we at war!</p>

<p>Well, it seems this alligator hadn't eat since
it come; and after Ruby had a double Bronx<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and two glasses of champagne the memory
of his hunger began to worry her&mdash;do you get
me? So she had him brought in and set in
the middle of the supper table on the orchids
at two dollars per each, which he sat on without
moving while the crowd tried everything
on him, from olives to wine, with no success.
The alligator seemed a awful boob, for he just
lay there like a stuffed one, which we knew he
wasn't on account of his not having eaten.</p>

<p>Well, Jim hadn't heeded me. I guess the
truth must be told, though, honest, he had took
but very little; still, being unused to it, the effect
was greater&mdash;do you get me? And pretty
soon he and this Von Hoffman was kidding
each other and that alligator something fierce.</p>

<p>Now Jim took a hate on this Von Hoffman
bird the minute he laid eyes on him, partly on
account of the costume of Ruby, and also on
general principles, because of the bird's accent.
But, the alligator not moving or nothing, Jim
asks if the alligator understands only German.</p>

<p>"In all probability," says Von Hoffman;
"he is a high-class alligator."</p>

<p>"Then he ought to understand American,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
says Jim. "He'll have to eventually; why not
now?</p>

<p>"There's nothing to prove that," says the
German bird with a sneer. "He will probably
get along very well as he is, with German
only."</p>

<p>Jim looked mad as a hatter; but instead of
taking it out on this Von Hoffman, as he had
ought to have, he turned on that poor dumb
beast.</p>

<p>"Well," says Jim to the alligator, "here's
where you learn some patriotism."</p>

<p>And he leaned 'way across the table until
his face was only an inch or two away from
the alligator's. Jim looked that animal
straight in the eye and spoke very severe.</p>

<p>"To hell with Germany!" says Jim.</p>

<p>And with that the alligator snapped&mdash;snapped
right onto the end of Jim's nose! Oh,
my Gawd, but I yelled! So did Jim&mdash;believe
you me! And then we all tried to get that
fiend of a pro-German alligator off Jim's face.
When they succeeded in making him let go
you had ought to of seen Jim's nose! It had
four holes in it and was bleeding something
fierce.</p>

<p>Oh, may I never live to see such a sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
again, let alone having to go through what followed!
For once I forgot my refinement
completely, and I remember yelling at Jim
to kill that German. For if he didn't sick his
alligator onto Jim, who did? And there he
stood laughing at Jim for all he was worth;
and Jim never offered to fight him!</p>

<p>Believe you me, all my sympathy for Jim
melted right away when I seen he wasn't doing
nothing but stand there holding on to his nose
and moaning.</p>

<p>"I know alligator bites is deadly poison!"
He kept saying it over and over again, while
Von Hoffman was laughing himself sick.</p>

<p>"I hope it is poison!" he says. "I hope it is,
you jackanapes of an American dancer!"</p>

<p>At this I walked right up to that Von Hoffman
bird.</p>

<p>"I'll get you for this!" I says. "Somehow
I know you're a wrong one, and <i>I'll</i> get you,
even if Jim don't want to! I'd enlist to-morrow
if I was a man and get your old Kaiser
as well!"</p>

<p>Then, the next thing I knew, me and Jim
was in the limousine, on the way to the hospital;
and Jim was still moaning over being
poisoned by the alligator and getting blood all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
over the place, and the car just relined and
everything! I didn't say a word just then,
because, of course, you must stick to a pal in
time of immediate trouble&mdash;do you get me?
But I was boiling mad inside, though worried
a little about the poison. Still, Jim's not hitting
that bird, Von Hoffman, was worse to
me than death itself.</p>

<p>At the hospital the chauffeur and me got
Jim inside somehow and to a desk in the hall.
There was a snappy-looking nurse sitting
there with a book, and our coming in at that
hour no more worried her than a fly in cold
weather. She just looked up quiet and spoke&mdash;sort
of unhospitable.</p>

<p>"Name of ailment?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Alligator bite!" I told her, brief; and I
will say this got her goat a little, because she
made me say it twice more before she would
believe me.</p>

<p>Then she directed us down a long hall, and
a young guy in a summer suit of white duck
stopped reading the newspaper long enough
to give Jim's nose the once over.</p>

<p>"No cause for alarm," says this bird. "The
nose will be about twice its normal size for a
day, that's all!" All! And, as if that wasn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
enough, he painted the nose and all round it
with some brown stuff, which stopped the
bleeding but made Jim look like he was made
up for some sort of comedy act. Jim was perfectly
sober by then and quit talking about
poison, and etc., and when he was back in the
limousine I just let myself go and bawled him
out good and plenty.</p>

<p>"Now see here, Jim," I says, "I've stuck
by you to-night long enough to make sure you
ain't goin' to die or nothin'; and now I'm
through!"</p>

<p>"You been just fine, Mary," says Jim, trying
to take my hand. I took it away quick.</p>

<p>"You don't get me!" I says. "I mean I'm
through for keeps. The engagement is
broken, and everything!"</p>

<p>"Whatter yer mean&mdash;broken?" says Jim,
sort of dazed.</p>

<p>"Just that!" I snapped. "Here you get
tight and take a insult from a German; and,
as if that wasn't enough, you go farther and
get bit by a pro-German alligator! And you
don't even offer to fight the German who owns
the alligator, either! And, what's furthermore,
you've got your face swoll up so's you
won't be able to dance to-morrow night; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
that iodine won't wash off; and the act is
crabbed in the bud&mdash;do you get me? Crabbed!
And I'm through&mdash;that's all! So don't never
come near me again!"</p>

<p>Believe you me, Jim tried to make me listen
to reason; but I couldn't hear no reason to listen
to, and so wouldn't let him say much. Then
Jim got mad and bawled me out for breaking
my rule and going on the party, and by the
time we got to my place we wasn't speaking at
all&mdash;not even good night or good-by forever!</p>


               <h3>II</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> hours and hours after Ma got me to bed
I just lay there thinking and aching and feeling
all hot and ashamed and terribly lonesome,
and with my career all ruined because of the
Germans&mdash;to say nothing of having been
obliged to become disengaged to Jim.</p>

<p>And then, just as I was nearly crazy wondering
how I was to get my self-respect back,
I got a swell idea. I would enlist! Ladies
could. I remembered reading a piece in a
newspaper some place about yeowomen or
something. And as soon as I realized that I
could serve Uncle Sam and help get even with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
that bird, Von Hoffman, and the Kaiser and
the alligator, and lose my personal feelings in
public service, I got the most wonderfully easy
feeling round my heart and dropped right off
to sleep. But when I woke up in the morning
it was something fierce, the way I felt. Believe
you me, it was just like I had ate Welsh
rabbit the night before, or something&mdash;the
weight that was on my chest. At first I
couldn't make out just what it was. Then I
remembered. I had lost Jim! Of course I
hadn't lost him so much as shook him; but it
was all the same, or looked that way in the
cold gray dawn of ten A. M.</p>

<p>Honest to Gawd, I never knew how fond I
was of Jim until I woke up that day and realized
he was gone forever! But I wouldn't of
phoned him and say I'd changed my mind&mdash;not
on a bet I wouldn't. And, anyways, I
hadn't changed my mind. The evidences begun
to pile up against him. I commenced to
remember how he had been away on some mysterious
trips so many afternoons for the last
four or five months; and maybe with some
blonde, for all I knew. And then his going
to pieces like that over a mere alligator bite,
the way he done; and, worst of all, not hitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
that German, even though in pain, and crabbing
our act by getting bit on the nose.</p>

<p>The more I thought about it, the worser
I felt, laying there in retrospect and negligee.
And I couldn't see no way of us ever getting
together again&mdash;even when he called up and
apologized; which, of course, I expected he
would do any minute. But he didn't; and by
the time Ma came in and routed me out of bed
I had myself worked up so's I was crying
something terrible, and hating Jim as hard as
I could, which would of been enough to kill
him&mdash;only for the pain in my heart for loving
him.</p>

<p>While I ate only a light repast of ham and
eggs, and a little marmalade, and etc., Ma
made me tell her all; which I done the best
way I could with crying in between. And then
I told her about me having made up my mind
to enlist. She was some surprised at that,
though not much. Ma, having lived through
two circuses and a trapeze act, it is sort of hard
to surprise her very much&mdash;do you get me?
So all Ma says was:</p>

<p>"Well, Mary Gilligan!" says she. "Can ladies
enlist? I had a idea," she says, "only gentlemen
was permitted."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," says I. "I see a piece in the paper
where ladies can go in the navy&mdash;yeowomen
they call them; a fancy name for a stenographer!"</p>

<p>"A whole lot too fancy!" says Ma, very
prompt. "And no daughter of mine, a decent,
respectable girl, is going sailing off on no battleship
with a lot of sailors&mdash;not to mention
submarines; not if I know it!" says Ma. "So,
Mary Gilligan, you may as well put that idea
out of your head, let alone you ain't a stenographer
and couldn't learn it in a month."</p>

<p>"Well, Ma," I says, "maybe you're right;
and I do get seasick awful quick. But&mdash;oh,
Ma! I got to enlist some place. Can't you
see the way I feel?"</p>

<p>Ma could.</p>

<p>"I know!" she says, very sympathetic. "I
was the same when your pa missed both the
third trapeze and the life net. I would of enlisted
when he died if there had been a war.
And, of course, you feel like Jim was dead.
How about the Red Cross?"</p>

<p>"Won't do for me," I says, prompt. "I
don't see myself sitting around in no shop, with
a dust cloth tied over my head, selling tickets.
I got to do something active or I'll go bugs!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Ma had a real idea.</p>

<p>"How about this here Woman's Automobile
Service?" says she. "The one I read you
the piece about? You're a woman and you got
a auto."</p>

<p>"Ma, you're a wonder!" I says. "Look up
the address while I get my hat on! Tell Musette
to call for the limousine; and watch me
make a trial for my new job!"</p>

<p>So they done like I asked, and I kissed Ma
and Musette good-by; also the two fool dogs,
for I had a sort of feeling like I was going into
battle already.</p>

<p>"When Jim calls up tell him it's no good&mdash;he
can't see me," says I, the last thing. And
then I set off in the limousine.</p>

<p>Well, I'd put on a very simple imported
model and a small hat, and only my diamond
earrings, and a brooch Jim had give me, when
we was first engaged, over my aching heart. I
wanted, above all things, to look refined; for,
even if the U. S. Army isn't always quite that,
still, this was a ladies' branch of it. And you
know what women can be&mdash;especially in organizations;
though I admit I hadn't had much
previous experience with them, except the
White Kittens, which Ma insisted on me keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
up with and contributing to their annual
ball, because of she having always belonged.
And&mdash;believe you me&mdash;the scraps I seen at
some of their Execution Committee meetings
would make the Battle of the Marne look like
a pinochle post-mortem!</p>

<p>Well, as I was saying, I took no chances on
appearances of refinement in this case, not
knowing exactly what class of ladies would
be running the Woman's Automobile Service.
And, even when I got to their office, it took
me several minutes before I got the right dope
on them and their line&mdash;do you get me?</p>

<p>In the first place, it wasn't at all like the
White Kittens' Headquarters, in the Palatial
Hotel ball-room. Instead, it was a shop on a
swell side street, with two very plain capable-looking
dark-green ambulances standing outside.
My limousine had to stop next door on
account of them.</p>

<p>Well, I got out and walked across and into
that shop. And&mdash;believe you me&mdash;it was the
plainest place you ever saw; not even so much
as a flower or a rug to give it a womanly touch.
But neat! My Gawd! And there was three
young ladies there, all in the snappiest-looking
uniforms you ever want to see&mdash;dark green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
like the ambulances, with gold on the collar,
and caps like the Oversea's Army, and the
cutest leggings! My!</p>

<p>Maybe you think they looked like a chorus?
They did not! They was as business-like as
English officers. Over in one corner a frowzy-looking
little dame was sitting, reading a book.
There wasn't no unnecessary furniture in the
place, and 'way at the back was a door marked
Captain Worth&mdash;Private, which seemed funny.</p>

<p>The minute I come in one of the girls
jumped up and says what could she do for me?</p>

<p>I seen at once she was a perfect lady.</p>

<p>"I am Marie La Tour," I says in a very
quiet, low-pitched voice, like a drawing-room
act.</p>

<p>"Yes?" says she. "And what can I do for
you, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"La Tour!" I says again, as patient as possible.</p>

<p>But it was plain she didn't get me, even the
second time, though it's a cinch she heard me
all right, all right. But the name simply
didn't mean nothing in her young life. Was
I surprised? I was! Of course if I had said
"I am Mrs. Vernon Castle," and she didn't
know who it was, I wouldn't of got such a jolt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
But Marie La Tour! Well, there's ignorance
even among the educated, and I realized
this and didn't try to wise her up any.
After all, I was not out for publicity, but for
serving my country. Besides, I had heard
right along that the army was full of democracy;
and, of course, this was some of it.</p>

<p>"Well," I says, "I would like to enlist. My
heart is broken, but full of patriotism, and this
seemed a good place to come."</p>

<p>"Good!" says this young lady, which I had
noticed by this time she had a lieutenant's uniform
on her, but not by any means intending
she was glad my heart was broken. "Good!"
she says. "Sit down and let me tell you about
our organization."</p>

<p>"Is it the regular army?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not yet," says she; "but we hope we will
eventually get official recognition. We are already
used by the Government for dispatch
and ambulance service and as escorts and drivers
for officers and members of the various departments;
also, as government inspectors. So
you see it is a very live work."</p>

<p>"And it's a awfully pretty costume," I says;
"so snappy."</p>

<p>"The uniform is only the outward sign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
what we are doing," says Miss Lieutenant.
"You have a car?"</p>

<p>"Outside," I says; "eight-thousand dollars,
and all paid for. You can have it if it's any
good to you. Ma always prefers the street
car anyways."</p>

<p>"Thank you; that is splendid!" says the lady
officer, very pleasant, but not exactly excited
over my offer&mdash;which was some offer at that.</p>

<p>She took out a slip of paper and begun filling
in some blanks on it.</p>

<p>First, the make of the car, and then the answers
to the questions she shot at me.</p>

<p>"Can we have it at a moment's notice?" she
said. "Yes? Good! Is it new? In good
condition? Do you loan or give it?"</p>

<p>"Give!" I says, brief. "I am not going to
be a piker to Uncle Sam."</p>

<p>At this the lady lieutenant actually came out
of her shell enough to give me a smile.</p>

<p>"That's the spirit!" she says. "We sometimes
have as many as twenty offers of cars
a day. But, as a rule, they are half-time loans.
Can you drive?"</p>

<p>"Drive a horse?" says I.</p>

<p>"No, no," says the kid, serious again, "a car,
of course!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, no," says I, feeling sort of cheap.
"Isn't there anything else I can do?"</p>

<p>"Plenty," she says, cheerfully; "but you will
have to learn to drive, first of all. You must
have a chauffeur's license, a doctor's certificate
of health, two letters of recommendation from
prominent citizens as to your loyalty and general
character, and a graduate's certificate from
a technical automobile school."</p>

<p>"Anything else?" I says, sort of faint.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, you will have to take the
nursing and first-aid course at St. Timothy's
Hospital," she says, "and the regular U. S.
Infantry drill. But that's about all."</p>

<p>"Do I have to learn all that stuff before I
can come in?" I asked, feeling about as small
as when I had my first try-out on the big time
circuit.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," says Miss Lieutenant; "you can
sign your application right away if you like.
Then you can come in immediately and start
rookie drill and the first-aid work with the
service while you are getting your technical
training."</p>

<p>Believe you me, my breath was about taken
away by all this stuff. I don't really know
now just what I did expect when I first come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
into that shop, but I guess I had a sort of idea
they'd give me a big welcome and I'd get a
costume of some sort; and, after that&mdash;well, I
don't really know. I certainly never expected
what they handed me. But I was game.</p>

<p>"When can I commence all this?" I says.</p>

<p>"When do you want to?" says Miss Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"To-day," I says firmly. At this Miss
Lieutenant actually smiled again.</p>

<p>"Good!" says she. "The minute you bring
me that health certificate and those letters of
recommendation I'll sign you up and you can
start in at the Automobile Training School.
To-morrow morning is the time at St. Timothy's
Hospital and to-morrow afternoon is
rookie drill."</p>

<p>"And when is the auto school?" I says.</p>

<p>"Every afternoon," she says.</p>

<p>"Then," says I, "I'll get them letters and
the certificate here by noon. And if you O. K.
them I'll just start in this P. M.&mdash;if it's all the
same to you."</p>

<p>"Good!" says Miss Lieutenant, evidently not
displeased, yet determined to show no emotion.</p>

<p>Then she got up, indicating that our business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
was over, clicked her heels together like a
regular officer, and made a stiff little bow.
Oh, wasn't she professional, just!</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be back," I says, and started to
go. "I'm sure I can get everything but the
technical stuff; and I'll get that if I die of it!"</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span>&mdash;believe you me&mdash;I had no idea how
near true them words was when I uttered them.
I was almost at the door when the frowzy little
dame in the corner, which I had forgotten
she was there, come over and touched me on
the arm.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, my dear," she says;
"but I want to tell you I think your spirit is
fine. And don't let any fear of the technical
course deter you. Even I was able to do it."</p>

<p>Was I surprised? I was! But she seemed
very sweet and kind, though so unnoticeable;
so I just says thanks, and then&mdash;believe you
me&mdash;started out on some rush!</p>

<p>First of all, I hustled up to old Doc Al's
place, which Ma and me has him for a doctor;
though Gawd knows there ain't never a blessed
thing the matter with our healths. Still, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
her trapeze days Ma has always felt that emergencies
do happen. Well, of course, he give
me a perfect certificate in less than ten minutes'
time, and I was off to see Goldringer,
head of the dancing trust; and him and his
partner, Kingston, each give me a elegant letter
of recommendation, than which I could
scarcely of got letters from any more prominent
citizens&mdash;unless, maybe, Pres. Wilson.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, I took all three recommends
down to the young lady lieutenant, and there
all was the same. Well, it was still lacking
five to twelve when I come in, and Miss Lieutenant
looked quite some surprised, though she
tried not to. The letters and the doc's certificate
was O. K.; and the first thing you know,
I was signed up and given three passes. One
for the auto school for two o'clock that same
P. M.; one for the hospital, calling for me to
be on hand for rehearsal of the nursing act at
nine o'clock next morning. The third was also
a call for rehearsal&mdash;a outdoor drill in the park
at three P. M. next day. It looked like I was
going to have a busy life.</p>

<p>"Well," I says, "would you like the car
now?" I says. "I can walk home just as good
as not."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, thanks," says Miss Lieutenant. "We
will call upon you for it when it is needed."</p>

<p>Believe you me, I was grateful for that, because
I ain't used to hustling round in the early
morning, and I had hustled some this time. So
I climbed in and says "Home, James!" and
dropped in on the seat and was carried uptown
for lunch.</p>

<p>While on the way I got the first chance I'd
had all morning to think about Jim, and to
wonder what he had said when he phoned to
apologize. And did the ache come back in my
heart when I got thinking of him? It did!
I felt almost sick with lonesomeness by the time
I got to the flat. And whatter you think?
Jim hadn't phoned at all! Not a peep out of
him!</p>

<p>At first I thought there must be some mistake;
but after I'd rowed with the operator in
the hall, and with Ma and Musette both, I come
to realize that the split between me and Jim
was real&mdash;that we was off each other sure
enough. And it was not so surprising that a
man which didn't hit a German whose alligator
had bit him wouldn't know how to treat a lady!</p>

<p>But somehow Jim's being so mean about not
phoning perked me up a lot and give me courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to think of going into that auto school. I
had commenced to be awful doubtful about it;
but Jim's neglect, together with the lunch Ma
had fixed, set me up a lot. And by one-thirty
by my wrist watch, and a quarter to two by
the mantel-piece clock, I had the strength to
struggle into a <i>demitallieur,</i> which is French
for any lady's suit costing over sixty dollars,
and get to the auto school by the time the lady
lieutenant had told them to expect me.</p>

<p>Oh, that auto school! The torture chambers
of this here Castle of Chillon has nothing
on it and&mdash;believe you me&mdash;the first set of
tools a person going into it needs is a manicure
set. The next thing they need is a good
memory, the kind which can get a twelve-hundred-line
part overnight; which no dancer can
nor is ever supposed to!</p>

<p>One thing I will say for that school, though&mdash;they
was not such a ill-informed lot as the
Automobile Service. From the very minute
I set foot inside the place they knew who I
was, and the manager give me the pick of half
a dozen young fellows who was just filled with
patriotic longing to help me qualify for the
service.</p>

<p>After giving them the once over I finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
decided on one lean-looking bird, who seemed
married, and quiet, and likely to teach me
something about the insides of an auto, instead
of asking me questions about the steps of the
Teatime Tango Trot, and did I feel the same
in my make-up?</p>

<p>Well, the first thing this bird asks me is do
I know anything about a car? And I says,
know what? And he says, well, can I name
the parts of a car? And I says, yes; and he
says for me to name them. So I says color,
lining, flower holder, clock, speaking tube and
chauffeur.</p>

<p>Well, the bird says so far correct; but that
wasn't enough, and he guessed we better begin
at the more fundamental parts and would
I just step inside?</p>

<p>Well, it seems this auto school undertakes
to teach you everything about a car from the
paint on the body to the appendix, or magneto,
as it is called, in twenty lessons; which is
like trying to teach the Teatime Tango Trot,
with three hand-springs and twenty whirls
round your partner's neck, by mail for five
dollars. Which is to say it can't be done.</p>

<p>First off, the instructor hands you a bunch
of yellow papers with a lot of typewriting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
them&mdash;twenty sheets in all, or one per lesson,
and all you got to do is learn them good and
then put into practice what you learn; and
after that what you can't do to a car would fill
a book!</p>

<p>Well, after you grab this sheaf of stage bank
notes you look at number one and follow the
bird that's teaching you round the room while
he reels it off. I guess the idea of you holding
the paper is to check him up if he makes
a mistake. Anyways, this bird let me in
among a flock of busted-looking pieces of machinery
and begun talking fast. At first, I
didn't get him at all; but when I got sort of
used to it I realized he was saying something
like this:</p>

<p>"The crank shaft is a steel drop-forging having
arms extending from center of shaft according
to number of cylinders. It is used to
change the reciprocating movement of the piston
into a rotary motion of the flywheel; it has
a starting handle at one end and the flywheel
at the other, as you observe. We will now
pass on to the exhaust manifold, which is generally
constructed of cast iron; it conducts the
burned gases from the exhaust valve . . ."</p>

<p>"Hold on!" I says. "Exhaust is right! I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
exhausted this minute. If you don't mind I'd
like to sit down and talk sense, instead of listening
to a phonograph monologue in a foreign
language."</p>

<p>The instructor bird seemed sort of winded by
this; but he got a couple of chairs and pretty
soon we was sitting in a quiet corner talking
like we'd both been on the same circuit for five
years.</p>

<p>"Now listen here, brother," I says real earnest;
"I want to learn this stuff, and learn it
right! And I want you to stick by me and see
me through, same as you would any male man
that come in here to learn to be a chauffeur.
Now take it easy and make me get it, and I'll
play square and do my best to understand,
without no nonsense."</p>

<p>"Say, you bet I will, Miss La Tour!" says
this bird, who, married or not, had some spirit
in him yet. "You bet I will! You see, a lot
of dames come in here just because they ain't
got nothing else to do. And you yourself
must realize that a guy can only go through
the motions when that's all they want."</p>

<p>Well, I could see that plain enough, and
from then on we got along like a new team of
partners with equal money in the act and going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
big on thirty straight weeks' booking.
And&mdash;believe you me&mdash;there is a awful lot of
interesting things about a auto; only you
would never suspect it until you start to look
at what is under the hood and body. As to
understanding them all, you couldn't get it
all off of no twenty sheets of yellow paper, nor
twenty hundred, either! It's a career, really
understanding a machine is; just the same as
being a expert dancer. The guy that invented
all them parts and got them working together
certainly must of set up nights doing it.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, after two hours of lapping
up this dope I got so's I could actually tell the
cam shaft from the crank shaft and the difference
between a cycle and a cylinder, which
was enough for one day. And then I rode
home to Ma.</p>

<p>Actually I had almost forgot to be miserable
about Jim for two whole hours! But when
I got home, and he hadn't phoned to apologize
yet, it all came back over me, and I simply felt
that, automobiles and enlistments or no, I
wanted to die&mdash;just die! I cried so bad that
even Ma couldn't make me mind, and I was so
tired I couldn't even taste the hot cakes she
had fixed. I do believe Ma would think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
cooking something tasty if the world was coming
to a end the next minute. She'd be afraid
the recording angel would need a sandwich and
a cup of hot coffee to keep him going while he
was on the job.</p>

<p>But, anyways, they couldn't do nothing to
me, or get me to go to the Ritz or the theater
much less the midnight show; but the last did
not matter, because I was wore out and asleep
long before. And so Ma had to telephone
that Miss La Tour was suddenly ill and unable
to appear. I made her swear not to phone
Jim nor let him in nor Roscoe, the publicity
man, if they was to come&mdash;not on no account.
And so I slept&mdash;poor child!&mdash;worn by the tossing
of the cruel ocean of life&mdash;do you get me?</p>

<p>Well, next morning I was up long before
Musette, and would of been obliged to dress
unaided, only for Ma never having got used
to sleeping late, partly on account of her always
taking a nap just after the matinée performance
when with the circus, and still continuing
the habit. So Ma give me my coffee
and a big kiss, and promised not to tell Jim
nothing if he telephoned and I set off to be
at the hospital at nine A. M., according to orders
from Miss Lieutenant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, there has always been something about
a hospital I didn't care for much; not that I
have went to many&mdash;only the night Jim got
bit by the alligator; and once, when me and
Jim was first engaged, he had a dog which we
had to take to the dog hospital. But&mdash;believe
you me&mdash;this St. Timothy's Hospital, was
quite different from the dog hospital. It was a
whole lot more like a swell hotel, with porters
and bell boys and clerks and elevators, and
everything except a café, as far as I could
make out; and I'm not sure about that, but I
don't suppose they had it.</p>

<p>I was so scared of being late that I was a
little early and had to wait in a office. Pretty
soon two or three other rookies come in; and,
being ladies, of course we didn't dare to speak
to each other at first. And then the ladies of
the Automobile Service commenced coming in,
wearing their uniforms. And were they a
fine-looking lot? They were! I sure did wish
I had a right to that costume; and I had a feeling
that my heart wouldn't hurt near so bad,
even when thinking of Jim, once it was beating
under that snappy-looking uniform coat in
Uncle Sam's service&mdash;do you get me?</p>

<p>Well, about this time we were let go upstairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
in one of them regular hotel elevators,
the rookies still scared, the regular members
in good standing talking among theirselves,
though several spoke to me nice and friendly;
in particular, the little frowzy one which had
been reading the book the day before in the
office, but wasn't at all sloppy in her uniform.</p>

<p>Believe you me, I had a awful funny feeling
in the middle of my stomach going up in that
elevator, and not for the same reason as the
Metropolitan Tower or any of them tall buildings,
either. It was because of not knowing
what was ahead of me and preparing for the
worst. After I'd seen the kind of stuff them
lady soldiers had to learn in the auto shop, it
seemed like about anything might be expected
of them in a mere hospital. So I got myself
all braced up so's if I had to cut off a leg, or
extract a tooth or anything, I'd be able to go
to it and not bat an eye-lash&mdash;not outwardly,
anyway.</p>

<p>But things is seldom as bad as you figure in
advance&mdash;not even first-night performances.
And the stuff which was actually put up to us
was simple as a ordinary one-step. At least,
it looked so from a distance. By distance I
mean this: When the nursing instructor&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
lady in a white dress, with the darndest-looking
little soubrette cap stuck 'way on the back
of her head&mdash;when she stood up in front of the
lot of us and put a Velpeau bandage&mdash;which is
French for sling, I guess, and looks it&mdash;on one
of the lady soldiers who was acting as mannequin,
why, it looked easy.</p>

<p>While she was putting it on she handed us
a line of talk something like that bird at the
auto school, only not so fluent. And when
she got through it was up to the rest of us to
put the Velpeau bandages on each other.
Gawd knows it was no cinch.</p>

<p>First, I set down, and a girl in uniform
asked could she wrap me up. Well, it just
naturally rumpled my Georgette blouse; but
what's a blouse to a patriot? I let her go to
it, and she done it so good and so quick that it
was all over before I knew it, as the dentist
says; and then it was up to me. Somebody
give me a nice new roll of bandage and told me
to get a model.</p>

<p>Well, I didn't have the nerve to ask any
one, me being so new and the name Marie La
Tour not meaning anything to nobody here.
And so here was me standing round like a fool,
not knowing how to commence, when up comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
that lady&mdash;her which had been so sloppy reading
a book in the office.</p>

<p>"Can't I be your model?" she offered, and&mdash;believe
you me&mdash;I could of almost cried, I
was so glad to have somebody take notice of
me.</p>

<p>I liked that dame more each time I seen her;
she sure was refined. Even her sloppiness was
refined&mdash;do you get me?</p>

<p>Well, as to real work, that sheaf of yellow
papers up to the auto school had nothing on
the bandaging game when it come to understanding
it properly. Believe you me, that
bandage had a will of its own, and the only way
to make it mind would of been to step on it and
kill it. But after a little I managed to tie
up the lady pretty good, and before I was
done I had my mind made up that Musette had
lost her regular job and was going to be a bandage
mannequin from that P. M. on until I
got the hang of the thing.</p>

<p>Well, when the scramble of putting on the
bandage was over and past, we was told that
after we got on to the theory we'd be sent down
to the Charity Ward for two solid weeks and
practice what we'd learned.</p>

<p>Well, I thought, if I ever get there Gawd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
help the charity patients! I guess the two
weeks won't qualify me for the Auto Service.
More likely I'll be ready for the Battalion of
Death, or whatever they call them Russian
women!</p>

<p>Well, when the bandages was all gathered
up we was dismissed, as they call it, and told to
report for drill in a certain place in the park,
it being a fine day.</p>

<p>I must say I didn't think a whole lot of the
hospital end of the game, because it wasn't
pleasant. Of course I had no intention to quit
in any way, but it sort of depressed me, what
with all that sickness going on round me and
the talk about wounds and bandages. And so
my mind wasn't took off Jim, like it was by
the auto work, me having a heart which needed
a little bandaging&mdash;only that can't be done,
of course.</p>


                   <h3>IV</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Well</span>, on the way home I cried some more.
And well I might. For when I got there had
Jim phoned? He had not! Nobody but
Goldringer, the manager, and Roscoe, the
publicity man, and a few unimportant nuts like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
that, and some of the newspapers. Ma had
stalled them off pretty good by saying it was
impossible to disturb me.</p>

<p>And it seems these people hadn't been able
to locate Jim anywheres, either. At first that
sounded sort of funny to me; but when I come
to think it over I realized about his nose, where
the alligator had bit him and the doctor had put
on the brown stuff, from which he wouldn't
naturally care to be seen&mdash;only no one could
say that it would prevent him using the phone,
which I also realized.</p>

<p>Well, after I eat a little liver and bacon,
and so on, which Ma had fixed for me, and cried
some, which made me feel better again, I
started out for drill; which means that now
comes the real important part of what happened
and the true measure of the tale, as the
poet says.</p>

<p>Well, it seems we rookies&mdash;and I must pause
to mention that I don't like that word rookies;
it sounds like something that would get the
hook amateur nights. Well, as I was saying,
we rookies was told to report at three o'clock
for a private drill, all of our very own. But
I was on to the fact that the regular members
in good standing would be there ahead of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to do well what we was about to do badly. So
I thought I would go early and sit out in
front, or whatever was the same thing, and try
and get a line on how it was done.</p>

<p>Believe you me, there ain't many steps I
can't get by seeing them done once; and if I
was to of gone up to the Palace and watch
Castle, or Rock and White, or any one of
them, when I come away I could do the steps
they pulled as good as if I had invented them!</p>

<p>Well, this was my idea in going up and seeing
the ladies drill. So there I was at the park
bright and early on a fine sunny afternoon,
with the ladies all in uniform. But I wasn't
in any too much time, for I'd no sooner got
there than a big roughneck of a feller&mdash;a regular
U. S. drill sergeant, I found out after&mdash;come
up and yelled: "Fall in!" Just as rude
as any stage director I ever seen! But the
ladies didn't seem to mind a bit. They didn't
fall into nothing though; they just hustled into
line and stood there.</p>

<p>"Ten-shun!" says the feller. And they all
stood like a chorus when the stage manager is
telling them he is going to quit the show if they
don't learn no better, and they're a bunch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
fatheads, and he's going to get them fired. In
other words, they stood perfectly still.</p>

<p>Well, after that it was something grand,
what those ladies did. I will say that when I
come down to the park that afternoon I
thought maybe I'd see some pretty fair chorus
work; you know&mdash;formations, and etc. But
this was no chorus work, it was soldiering. I
never seen anything neater in my life. Was it
snappy? It was! And when I thought how
that bunch of ladies knew all about autos from
soup to nuts, and about bandages, and etc.,
believe you me&mdash;that drill was the finishing
touch.</p>

<p>For once in my life, I was anxious to be in
the chorus, even in the back line. But not forever&mdash;not
much! Believe you me, I made up
my mind that, once I was really in it, I was
going to work for a speaking part like I never
worked before. And meantime I started in
that direction by trying to figure out just what
the ladies did when the stage manager&mdash;I
mean, officer&mdash;hollered at them. And&mdash;believe
you me&mdash;I had the turn-on-the-heel and
push-off-with-the-toe idea on that right-and-left
face stuff long before the regular members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
in good standing was dismissed and we lady
rookies was called.</p>

<p>Well, the same roughneck which had drilled
the others had us simps wished on to him; and
the first thing he done was to get us in a row
&mdash;you couldn't properly call it a line&mdash;and then
stand out in front and look at us sort of hopeless
and discouraged, like a good director which
has just finished with a bunch of old-timers
and is starting with green material for the back
row. Then he commenced talking.</p>

<p>Well, while this bird was getting off a line
of talk about us now being soldiers of the
U. S. A. and that being no joke to him or us,
and etc., and etc., but no instructions in it, I
let my mind wander just a little, on account
of me having enlisted for deeper reasons than
any he mentioned and him quite incapable of
strengthening them.</p>

<p>And while my mind wandered this little bit,
and I was thinking how funny it felt to be back
in the chorus&mdash;do you get me?&mdash;I happened to
take a look at the houses facing the park. And&mdash;believe
you me&mdash;I got a jolt, for there we
was standing right opposite Ruby Rosalie's
house!</p>

<p>Well, I was that astonished to realize it you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
could of knocked me over with a sudden noise!
Up to then I had been so interested in the other
ladies and what they was doing I hadn't even
noticed it.</p>

<p>And then, before I could really commence
to think what a awful thing it would be if Ruby
was to look out of the window and see me
standing there, and think I was just in some
chorus, and maybe that nasty Von Hoffman
with her, and the both of them laughing their
fool heads off, the officer says "Ten-shun!" he
says. And, of course, I tenshuned, because
of me being anxious to get everything he said
when it come to instruction, and get it right.</p>

<p>Well, he told us a lot of dope on one thing
at a time after he had got us in line, with the
tallest at the right hand, which was me. And
he told us very simple and then made us do it;
and no camouflage, because&mdash;believe you me&mdash;he
could spot any lady which done it wrong
quick as a flash.</p>

<p>I will say he didn't have a whole lot of
trouble with me, partly on account of me having
had similar work before, and also my feet
taking to new things so easy. But it took me
about ten minutes to see that my patent Oxfords,
with the Looie heels, was never going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
to do for this work. Though I hate to say
it, the other ladies sure did bother him a lot.
They couldn't seem to mind quick enough.
And he had a lot of trouble making them keep
at attention.</p>

<p>Every time we'd be that way, just to show
what I mean, the lady next to me would forget
and powder her nose. Oh, that wasn't no new
sight to me! I seen worse in my day until
they get used to it. But did that officer get
mad? He did!</p>

<p>"Whatter ye think ye're at?" he yells. "A
pink tea? Cut that stuff now! Attention is
attention and youse is standing at it," he says.
"The worst crime youse can commit is move
without permission."</p>

<p>And&mdash;believe you me&mdash;I sympathized with
him, I did, little knowing what I was about to
do next my ownself.</p>

<p>Alas, that in ladies obedience comes so much
harder than following out a impulse! For the
officer had no sooner uttered them words, and
I agreed with him, than I went back on him
something terrible.</p>

<p>It was this way: As I explained, we was
drilling in the park, and not alone in the park
but also opposite Ruby Roselle's house. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of course, we was drilling on a open piece of
grass, but at one side of this here grass was
fancy bushes; you know&mdash;hedges and what
not. And me, being on the end of the line,
was nearest them bushes.</p>

<p>Well, as the sergeant was speaking I seen
something move under one of them bushes;
and, as Heaven is my witness, there was that
pro-German alligator which had bit Jim on the
nose and started all my troubles. There he
was, walking very slowly, gold-and-diamond
collar and all, and by his lone self, with nobody
to protect him!</p>

<p>Well, I never stopped to think or salute, or
ask nothing of nobody. All I knew for the
time was that that damn alligator had somehow
got out on his own, and that this was the
chance of a lifetime. So, without more ado,
I fell right out of attention and rushed over
and reached into the bushes and grabbed the
alligator by the tail.</p>

<p>Well, the officer hollered something at me, I
don't know what, and all the ladies commenced
screaming. And was I scared of that alligator?
I was! But I held him up by the tail,
and it didn't take me two minutes to find out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
that he couldn't bite me that way; and then
my scare was gone.</p>

<p>I felt so good about getting him I didn't
even care much what was being said at me by
the drill sergeant. I just stood there holding
tight to the alligator's tail and grinning all over
myself. But up come Miss Lieutenant, who
had been watching our drill&mdash;the one which had
signed me up&mdash;and she was as mad as a hornet,
only having a awful time trying not to
laugh.</p>

<p>"What's this?" she says, indignant.</p>

<p>Fortunately the alligator was in my left
hand; so I saluted.</p>

<p>"Enemy alien alligator!" I says.</p>

<p>"Dismissed from the ranks!" she says.
"And report to Sergeant Warner at Headquarters
at five o'clock."</p>

<p>Gee, but that made me feel bad! But she
wouldn't listen to no explanations at all, and
there was nothing for me to do except walk
off to where the limousine was waiting. And,
in a way, I was glad, because suppose Ruby
had of looked out and saw the alligator in my
hand! I couldn't of got away with him.</p>

<p>As things went, I got him safe into the limousine.
And&mdash;believe you me&mdash;I didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
dare set him down for a minute for fear of his
trying to get even with me; and so I was
obliged to hold him at arm's length until we
got home, which it is a good thing that it wasn't
very far.</p>

<p>Well, when we got home you ought to of
seen the elevator boys get out of the way! I
walked in holding on to the alligator; and once
I got to the flat there was Ma sitting in the
Looie-the-Head-Waiter drawing-room, reading
a cook-book. When she seen what I had
I must say that for once she acted kind of surprised.</p>

<p>Of course, she ain't usually surprised, not
after her having twice seen sudden death in the
center ring, and the circus went on just the
same. But alligators coming in unexpected is
rather out of the usual. So Ma marked her
place at sauces for fish, and took off her glasses
so's she could see good, and give me the kind
of stare she used to hand out when I got dirt
on my Sunday-school dress.</p>

<p>"Why, Mary Gilligan!" she says. "For the
land's sakes, where did you get that?"</p>

<p>"Caught it on the wing!" I says, very sarcastic,
on account of my arm being nearly broke.
"Can you cook it for supper?" I says.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," she says. "I guess I can. What is
it? A mock turtle?"</p>

<p>"It's a pro-German alligator," I says. "And
if you'll just kindly help me instead of standing
there staring at it, we'll intern it some place
so's I can leave my arm get a rest."</p>

<p>Well, we certainly had a fierce time finding
something to put him in, owing to us not being
able to agree about what kind of a place he
belonged. Ma was all for the goldfish bowl,
claiming it was his native element; and Musette,
who come in, thought the canary cage
was better. But, realizing he couldn't jump
very high, I had them get a big hat-box, and
set him in that.</p>

<p>"And now what are you going to do with
him?" says Ma as we all stood 'round looking
at him; and my two fool dogs barking their
heads off on account of a mistaken idea they
had that he was a new pet. "What are you
going to do with him?" says Ma.</p>

<p>"Unless you cook him, I don't know," I
says&mdash;"except for one thing: I'm going to take
that gold-and-diamond collar offen that brute
and sell it and give the money to the American
Red Cross; and I'm going to do it now!"</p>

<p>Believe you me, I was mad at that alligator!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
And no wonder! Just look at all the trouble
he made me! So I didn't waste any time getting
action against him. First off, I persuaded
Ma, who was real brave, to hold a ice
pick down on his nose good and firm, so's he
couldn't open his face. Then I managed,
after a lot of trouble, to get that bejeweled
sinful collar off his neck. And was it a swell
collar? It was!</p>

<p>As soon as I had it off we just left that
alligator interned in the hat-box and looked the
collar over good. It was made all of a piece
and the jewels were certainly wonderful. I
know quite a lot about them, me and Ma always
having invested that way when we had
a little extra cash.</p>

<p>Well, as we was looking the stones over
carefully, I happened to rub one which was
close to the snap, sort of sideways, and right
off something happened: That there collar
parted&mdash;yes, sir; parted!&mdash;the lining from the
outside, and in the place between the setting
and the inside frame was a couple of thin slips
of paper!</p>

<p>Well&mdash;believe you me&mdash;it didn't take me
long to get the idea; not after having a father
and a mother which had been in the circus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
had to think quick, and me having been associated
with dramatic stuff all my life&mdash;do you
get me? You do!</p>

<p>What with that collar having come off a
alligator which I was already convinced was
a pro-German, and knowing Von Hoffman
had give it to Ruby Roselle, and got her to
sing Overseas in that nasty costume made out
of the national colors, which should never be
done, I seen everything clear. Von Hoffman
had a German job of some kind!</p>

<p>And when I unfolded those papers and seen
they was full of funny little marks like a stenographer
makes and then can't read, I realized
that I had happened in on it; and so will
any intelligent public.</p>

<p>Well, was Ma and Musette full of questions?
They was! But I didn't wait to answer
none of them; for I realized, also, that it
was almost five o'clock, and I was supposed to
report at Headquarters for a bawling-out at
that time. And, after me having broken the
rules once, I had no wish to do it again so soon.</p>

<p>Well, I just grabbed up the collar and the
papers, and a clean pair of gloves, as the alligator
had completely ruined what I had, and,
having on my hat, waited not to explain, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
made a dash for the street. And by a big piece
of luck there was the limousine, still standing
outside on account of I having forgot to
tell John to go. Well, I told him "Headquarters!"
and off we started; and I got there
just on the dot of five o'clock.</p>

<p>Well, Miss Lieutenant was there, and a Miss
Sergeant&mdash;the one I was reporting to&mdash;and
that frowzy-looking lady I have spoke of before,
and several other ladies, still in their uniforms.
And while I was explaining, in comes
the captain, which she certainly is a smart
woman. And they all listened while I reported
and told the whole story about Ruby
and me and Jim and Von Hoffman and the
alligator. Then I saluted and handed over
said collar and papers in evidence; and then
the captain spoke up:</p>

<p>"This material, which is undoubtedly in a
foreign code, will be of interest to the Secret
Service," she says. "This Von Hoffman is
probably one of those persons who are active
in the obviously deliberate effort to cheapen
and degrade the quality of our patriotism,"
she says; "for I have heard that is part of the
German propaganda here."</p>

<p>"Private La Tour, in view of the unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
circumstances, you are excused for your action
in leaving ranks without permission," she
says; "but next time remember to get your
salute recognized," she says&mdash;"even under extreme
conditions."</p>

<p>Then she went on, and she says:</p>

<p>"I understand you have given your car,"
she says. "Some member in uniform will take
this evidence downtown in Private La Tour's
car," she says, "which we now accept for the
service."</p>

<p>Then she walked into her office, which said
Private on it, and closed the door; and I
watched one of the ladies in uniform go away,
with the collar and the papers, in my limousine.</p>

<p>And after she had went I got a terrible
scare, for it come over me all of a sudden that
I hadn't even a nickel change on me to buy car
fare home!</p>

<p>Well, just as I was standing there wondering
how I was going to hoof it after the
trying day I had had, that frowzy lady comes
up to me, real kind, like she could almost see
what I was thinking of; and she says:</p>

<p>"May I take you home in my car, Miss La
Tour?" she says. "I have seen you dance so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
often that I feel as though I knew you. I am
Mrs. Pieter van Norden."</p>

<p>Just get that, will you, will you? Her that
I had been modeling myself on for refinement
for years! And&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;on
the way home she told me she had been trying
to dance like me since the first time she seen me!</p>

<p>Well&mdash;believe you me&mdash;I felt so good over
this, and over having got the goods on Von
Hoffman, and about being excused for making
that bad break at drill, and not getting
fired out of the Automobile Service, that I
only commenced feeling bad about Jim and me
again after Mrs. Van Norden had left me at
the door of my place, and I was going up in
the elevator.</p>

<p>As I was letting myself in with my key I
got so low in my mind again that I felt I would
just die if Jim hadn't phoned; and I knew he
hadn't, for I'd given up hope. Well, I
opened the door and went in. And then I
got another shock; for right in the middle of
the drawing-room stood Jim.</p>

<p>Well, first off, I didn't know him on account
of him being in khaki; but when he turned
around I nearly died for sure! But I didn't
actually die. What I done is nobody's business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
but mine and Jim's. But I will say it was
a second lieutenant-of-aviation uniform; and
they show powder on the shoulder something
terrible.</p>

<p>And he had been studying for months; and
that's where he was every afternoon, and not
out with some blonde, and wouldn't tell me for
fear he wouldn't get it!</p>

<p>And I'm going to dance alone at night until
he comes back, and all day drive a truck or
something to release a man. And that's the
whole inside story of the split, which is now
readily seen is not a fight at all, at least not yet
for we got married at once.</p>

<p>So, only one thing more: Regarding that
alligator, Ma decided he would be too hard to
cook. So Jim took him to camp for a mascot,
and by the time he got through there he learned
to understand American&mdash;believe you me!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ain't</span> it remarkable the way the war has
changed the way we look at a whole lot of
things? Take wrist-watches for one. Before
the military idea was going so strong on its
present booking but a little while, wrist-watches
had grabbed off a masculine standing
for themselves, and six months before no real
man would of been willingly found dead in

<p>Then take newspapers! Oncet we used to
look at them for news, and now we just look
at them. It's kind of a nervous habit, I guess.
And take simple little things like coal and
sugar. Why once we paid no attention to
them and now we look at them real respectful&mdash;when
we see them. Which leads me on to
say that the war has brought us to look at a
great many things we never even seen before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
not if they was right under our noses. That's
how I come to see that letter from the W.S.S.
Committee&mdash;and would to Heaven I had not,
as the poet says. For although&mdash;believe you
me&mdash;most of the mail order goods a person
buys is pretty apt to be as rep. because why
would a customer write again which had been
stung once, and thrift stamps is no exception,
it certainly will be a long time before I fall so
easy for anything the postman slips me. Next
time I'll recognize that his whistle is a note
of warning to more than them which has unpaid
bills, which I have not and so never listened
for him.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, the time this little trouble
maker reached my side, I had slipped into a
simple little lounging suit of pink georgette
pajamas, and was lying on the day-bed in a
regular wallow of misery on account of wondering
if Jim was dead on the gory fields of
France, or was it only the censor&mdash;do you get
me? I was laying there rubbing a little cold
cream onto my nose and thinking how would
it feel to be always able to do so without losing
my husband's love, which, of course, would
mean he had died at the front, when in comes
Ma with a couple of letters. I give one shriek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and sprung to my feet, like a regular small-time
drama, and grabbed them off her, cold
cream and all. And then slunk back upon the
day-bed and despair when I seen they weren't
from Jim. Ma stood there with her hands on
her hips until she seen I wasn't going to break
any bad news to her, when she left me in peace
to read them. That is she meant to, but believe
you me, it was far from it as Ma went
into our all-paid-for gold furnished parlour
and commenced playing on the pianola which
Jim had give me for a souvenir before he
sailed, and Ma, being sort of heavy and strong,
after twenty-five years with a circus, she has a
fierce touch.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, after she had got "Soft and
Low" going strong with the loud pedal and no
expression, I opened the first envelope. It was
my copy of my new contract with Goldringer
all signed and everything and calling for only
twenty minutes of my first class A-1 parlour
dancing act in his new musical show at the
Springtime Garden entitled "Go To It" and
which let all persons know that the party of
the first part hereinafter called the manager
was willing and able to pay Miss Marie La
Tour, party of the second ditto, one thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
dollars a week. Which certainly was <i>some</i>
party to look foreward to and scarcely any
work to speak of, a refined act like mine not
calling for over three handsprings and some
new steps, which is second nature to me and I
generally make up a few every night for my
own amusement same as some of those fellows
which play the piano by hand&mdash;do you get me?</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>Well, anyways, when I had looked the contract
over good and seen it really was, as I
had before realized in the office, more than satisfactory,
I salted it away in my toy safe which
was nicely built into the mantel-piece for the
greater convenience of burglars, and then I remembered
the other envelope. All unsuspecting
as a table d'hote guest, I opened the envelope,
and then almost dropped dead.</p>

<p>It was from President Wilson!</p>

<p>Believe you me, I leaned up against the art-gray
wall paper and prepared to faint after I
had read the news. But instead of commencing,
"I regret to inform you of the death in
battle," or something like that, it started:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">
"The White House,<br />
"Washington, D. C.<br />
</p>

<p>"I earnestly appeal to every man, woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and child to pledge themselves to save constantly
and to buy as regularly as possible the

as far as possible through membership in War
Savings Societies.</p>

<p>"The man who buys War Savings Stamps

<p>"May there be none unenlisted in the great

<p class="author">
"<span class="smcap">Woodrow Wilson</span>."<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Woodrow Wilson! Signed&mdash;and addressed
to <i>me!</i> Of course it didn't exactly begin
"Dear Miss La Tour" or anything like that,
and he had signed it with a rubber stamp or
something which I did not hold against him
in the least, me realizing at once what a busy
man he must be. But coming as it done instead
of a death-notice which I had by this
time fully expected after no letter for over a
month, it got to me very strong. It made me
feel all of a sudden that I was a pretty punk
patriot lounging around in pink georgette
pajamas which&mdash;believe you me&mdash;is no costume
for war-work and felt like going right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
off and borrowing one of the gingham house-dresses
which I have never been able to break
Ma of, only, of course, it would of been too
big and anyways what would I of done after
I had it pinned around me? Which could be
said of a whole lot of folks which were rushing
into uniforms of their own inventing.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, after the first shock was
over, I seen there was an enclosure with the
President's letter. This was from some committee
which had a big W.S.S. lable printed
at the top and a piece out of the social register
printed underneath, and was dated N. Y.
It begun more personal.</p>

<p>"Dear Miss La Tour," it said. "As a
woman so prominent in the theatrical world,
we feel sure that you would be glad to take
an active interest in the great Thrift movement
which is now before the country. Will you not
form a theatrical women's committee that will
pledge the sale of twenty-five thousand dollars'
worth of stamps on the first of the month?
The first of every month will be observed as
Thrift Stamp Day, and we will be glad to furnish
you with all literature, stamps, etc., if
you will notify headquarters of your willingness
to do this work."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter was signed by some guy which it
was impossible to read his name because he
hadn't used no rubber stamp but did it by hand
and had other things on his mind. But did I
care? I did not! Believe you me, I had already
decided to do like he asked, and why
would I need to know his name when I wasn't
going to write to him anyways, but to Mr. Wilson?
Dancing as long as I have which is about
fifteen years or since I could walk, pretty near,
and not only professionally but drawing my
own contracts from the time most sweet young
things is thinking over their graduation
dresses, I have learned one thing, if no other.
Always do business with the boss. Refuse to
talk to all office boys, get friendly with the
lady stenographer, if there is one, but do all
business with the one at the head&mdash;and no
other! This motto has saved me no end of
time which has been spent in healthy exercise
under my own roof and Ma's eagle eye, which
otherwise might have wore out the seats of
outside-office chairs.</p>

<p>And so I concluded that I'd sit right down
that minute and let Mr. Wilson know I was
on the job. I knew I had some writing paper
someplace and after I had took a lot of powder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and chamois and old asperin tablets out of
the desk I dug it up:&mdash;a box of handsome
velour-finish tinted slightly pink, with envelopes
to match. And I got hold of a pen
and some ink which Musette, my maid, had
overlooked, she being a great writer to her
young man which is French and Gawd knows
how fluent she writes him in it, only of course
being born over there certainly makes a difference.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, I cleaned off the desk and
rubbed the cream off my nose and hands and
set down to write that letter. And&mdash;believe
you me&mdash;it was some job. I guess I must
of commenced a dozen times and tore them
up with formal openings&mdash;do you get me?
And then I realized that the box of pink tinted
was getting sort of low and I had better waste
not want not, and so determined to just be
natural in what I wrote but not take up his
time with too long a letter. So at last I threw
in the clutch, gave myself a little gas, and we
was off, to this effect.</p>

<blockquote><p>"My dear Mr. Wilson:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Many thanks for yours of the 25th inst.
Will at once get busy at helping to make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
first of the month savings day instead of unpaid-bill
day.</p>

<p class="center">
"Cordially,<br />
<span class="smcap"  style="margin-left: 6em;">"Marie La Tour.</span>"<br />

</p></blockquote>

<p>This seemed refined and to the point, and
although I was awful tempted to put a P.S.
asking did they know anything about Jim, I
left off on account of me not believing in asking
personal favors of the Government just
now, as the war office was probably medium
busy and the Censor might answer first, at
that. So I just sealed it up as it was, and
about then Ma left off playing on my souvenir
and came in with a pink satin boudoir cap down
tight over her head. Ma just can't seem to get
over the idea that boudoir caps at five dollars
and up per each is a sort of de lux housework
garment.</p>

<p>"I'm just going in the kitchen and beat up
a few cakes for lunch," said Ma, and withdrew,
leaving me to lick on three cents and
shoot the letter fatefully and finally down the
drop near the gilt-bird-cage elevator of our
home-like little flat. I felt awfully relieved
and chesty somehow when it was done and with
her good news ringing in my ears. For Ma is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
certainly some cook, and she has it all over our
chef, who&mdash;believe you me&mdash;knows she would
never be missed if she went although Ma simply
can't learn to stay out of the kitchen. And
while she was busy with the butter and eggs
and sugar and wheat flour, I was deciding to
call a committee, because I knew that was the
way you generally start raising twenty-five
thousand dollars worth of anything, except a
personal note.</p>

<p>Committee meetings is comparative strangers
to me except the White Kittens Annual
Ball, and a few benefit performances which
last is usually for the benefit of those which
are to be in it, they leaving aside all consideration
of the benefit of the audience much less of
the charity it is supposed to be for, and
the main idea being how long each actor can
hold the spotlight. You may have noticed
how these benefit performances runs on for
hours.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, I having been to several
such as of course the best known parlour dancing
act in America and the world, like mine
undoubtedly is, is never overlooked. And I
knew we had to get a place with a big table
and chairs set around it and then the committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
was started. So the White Kittens always
having met in the Grand Ball Room of the
Palatial Hotel, I called up the place and hired
the room for the next morning at twelve-thirty,
me being determined that my Theatrical
Ladies Committee should get there directly
after breakfast. The cost of the room was one
hundred dollars, and I didn't know was the
Government to pay it or us, but I was, of
course, willing to do it myself if necessary.
Anyways it was a committee-room, I knew
that by reason of my having sat in it as such
at least twice each year since the place was built&mdash;way
back in '13. Then all I had to do was
get my committee.</p>

<p>I had just about dived for the telephone book
to see who would I call up, when Ma come in,
taking off the pink satin cap and wiping her
face.</p>

<p>"I made a omlette," said Ma. "Come catch
it before it falls!"</p>

<p>And so I called it the noon-whistle though
some might of called it a day, and we went in
and while we ate only a simple little lunch of
the omlette (which we got at first base) and
liver and bacon and cold roast beef and a few
stewed prunes with the fresh cake, I told Ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
about what had happened, and how I had already
got after the job.</p>

<p>"Well, Mary Gilligan, you done the right
thing!" said Ma. "And what kind of costume
are you going to wear?"</p>

<p>"The notices don't say anything about a uniform,"
I explained to her. "And I'm pretty
sure you don't need any. This is the sort of
thing our leading society swells are taking up
so heavy," I says, "and to do it is not only patriotic
but feminine to the core," I says.</p>

<p>"Will you have to stand on the street-corners
and worry the life out of folks?" Ma
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Not much!" I says. "That stuff is for the
hoi-poli and idle rich and kids and unemployed.
That's where some of the new democracy comes
in. Us with brains is to do the office work.
Them with good hearts only can do theirselves
and the country more service in the stores and
street-cars selling something that don't belong
to them," I says, "and&mdash;believe you me&mdash;I bet
any American gets a funny sensation doing
that little thing."</p>

<p>Ma looked real impressed for a minute,
showing she hadn't any idea what I was talking
about. Then she come back to her main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
idea with which she had started which you can
bet she always does until she gets through with
it her own self.</p>

<p>"Well, I think you ought to have something
for a uniform," she says. "Say a cap and
maybe a trench coat!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't wear no trench coat around the
Forty-Second Street and Broadway trenches,"
I says. "I wouldn't actually have the nerve
to insult the army like that!"</p>

<p>And Ma seen what I meant and said no more
which it certainly is remarkable how good we
get on for Mother and daughter.</p>

<p>So she only urged me to have another cream-cake,
which I took and then I made for the
phone and started calling up some ladies to
form the committee out of. After thinking
the matter over very careful I finally decided
on six of the most prominent in my line which
was, of course, the Dahlia sisters which had
been often on the same bill with me and, of
course, they ain't really related&mdash;no such team
work as theirs was ever pulled by members of
the same family, unless maybe when knocking
some absent member&mdash;do you get me? Well,
anyways, beside them I got Madame Clementina
Broun, the well known Lady Baritone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
she being a rather substantial party which
would give weight to us in cabaret circles. Of
course Pattie The Dancer had to be asked, she
being so prominent especially as to her tights
and strong pull with Goldringer but I only
done it out of diplomacy, which any one knows
committees has to have a lot of. And she is
less diplomatic than me as well, for instead of
just accepting for her own self she accepts also
for some friends which I had not invited, and
she did not name. Pattie is alias Mrs. Fred
Hutchins&mdash;him who gets up those reviews&mdash;you
know&mdash;which is the only reason she is
starred in them for Gawd only knows a child
which had been started anywheres near right
could of done her steps at the age of seven,
they being mere hard-sole clog with no arm
movements but having a great many imitators
among college boys and such, that scare-crow
stuff being as showy as it is easy.</p>


<p>Well, anyways, when I had got this far I
had one vacancy on my hands and as our Allies
was not sufficiently represented so far, decided
on Mlle. DuChamps which of course she
was really born in Paris, Indiana, but as a
toe-dancer is unequalled in any language and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
has a lovely broken accent. So there we had
France. Madame Clementia was married to
a Italian and he being dead or something I
never asked what I felt she was a safe Ally because
she couldn't of revolted, not if a
schrapnel was to have went off under her.
Pattie was of course Irish and the Dahlias'
Jewish, and Gawd knows what the other girl
was and I didn't care.</p>


                      <h3>II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> they had all promised to get theirselves
waked up on time and be over to the Palatial,
I kind of weakened on Ma's suggestion
about clothes. Of course I wasn't going to
fall for that uniform stuff, but when me and
Musette looked over my clothes I simply
didn't have a thing to wear. Every one of
my dresses was too morning or evening
or something and above all things I do
believe in dressing a part, and certainly I
had nothing which looked like a chairmaness.
So after getting into a simple little sports costume
of violet satin and my summer furs, and
taking a peep into the mail box to see had anything
got by the censor yet which of course it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
hadn't, I started out to buy me something
which would be quiet but tasty and snappy because
nothing inspires respect in a ladies committee
like a dress none of them has seen before.</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed how you can pass up
something which has been right under your
nose day after day and then all of a sudden
you hitch on to something which belongs to it
and then all you see is that thing&mdash;do you get
me? Say yellow kid boots. You never even
noticed a pair, but one day you buy them and
next time you're out every second woman has
them on. Or you go into mourning for somebody
and all of a sudden you commence noticing
how many other people is the same only
of course there ain't over the average&mdash;it's only
that you notice it because you are in it. Well,
believe you me&mdash;that first afternoon I went
out after receiving the President's letter, I was
that way with this W.S.S. stuff. Of course
I had bought my thousand dollars worth the
first week they was out, as had also Ma and
she and I together the same for Musette. But
we had done it on the Liberty Loans the same,
also Red Cross and thought we was through
and all the signs and posters and what not had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
come to be invisible to me like a chewing-gum
or a soap ad&mdash;do you get me?</p>

<p>But now I was in it and not only did I see
every sign and see them good, but felt like I
had one on my back and everybody must know
about the letter and everything. I walked
kind of springy, too, in spite of the furs, and
then when I turned into the Avenue, me being
on foot, a five mile walk per day having to be
got away with by me or Ma would know the
reason why, the trouble commenced. Believe
you me, I must of refused to buy thrift stamps
one hundred times in twenty blocks, and every
time I said I had all I could, the look I got
handed me would have withered a publicity
man. There must be a hot lot of fancy liars
among us, with no imagination, for why would
W.S.S. still be on sale if everybody had bought
that much? And when I wasn't refusing to
buy stamps I was forking out quarters for
everything from blind Belgian hares to Welch
Rabbits for German prisoners. And it's a
good thing I had a charge account to Maison
Rosabelle's or I would never of got my dress.
And the more I was pestered to buy them
stamps the madder I got. I commenced to
feel it was a regular hold up, and that the police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
ought to interfere. A person which is pestered
to death will even sour on the Red Cross.
I don't mean that they ain't humane, neither&mdash;only
that they are human, and the most dangerous
thing to do to a human is to bore it&mdash;any
one in the theatrical professions learns
that young and thoroughly. And when I realized
that I was getting bored with this constant
hold-up I got a fearful jolt and a cold
chill.</p>

<p>Here I was undertaking to chair a committee
to sell the things and Gawd knows my
heart ought to of been in it with Jim over there
and all, and it was, only getting bored with
the war is kind of natural, it being so far off
and nothing likely to do us personal bodily injury
on the Avenue unless maybe the restaurants
or a auto and that our own fault. And
so soon as I realized what I was up against
with the great Boredom Peril, I realized also
what I had personally in writing promised Mr.
Wilson, and took a brace. It was just like the
early days on the Small-Time when the booking
depends on the hand and the hand was the
one which fed us&mdash;and not any too much at
that with the carrying expenses&mdash;and the hand
was getting weaker. Me and Ma sat up all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
one night doping out my double handspring
with the heel-click. And it was a desperate
effort and we thought it was a flivver but not
at all. When I landed on my feet after the
first try-out, I knew I was there to stay, and
any intelligent public will realize that I remembered
it now. And by this time I had
reached the store I was headed for.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I will confess that from the moment I had
decided to buy a new dress I had my mind all
set on what it was to be&mdash;something sheer and
light&mdash;printed chiffon, and a hat to go with it.
But by the time I had reached Maison Rosabelle
my hunch on my new job was beginning
to go strong and one of the things that worried
me was that dress. Also my lunch.
Sometimes it happens that too much of a good
thing is the only thing which will turn you
against it&mdash;do you get me? And Ma's cream
cakes had this effect. Maybe had I eat less
of them I would not have had no indigestion
and so not counted their cost as Lincoln, or
somebody, says. And if I hadn't had the
indigestion maybe I wouldn't of worried over
the dress. Well, anyways, the first person I
see inside the store was Maison herself, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
elegant and slim, only with a little too much
henna in her hair as usual.</p>

<p>"Well, Masie," I said when we had got into
the privacy of the art-gray dressing room and
lit a cigarette, while the girl went for some
models. "Well, Masie, I want to know is
business good?" Masie is her real name she
having Frenchified it for business reasons, the
same as myself.</p>

<p>"Oh, dearie!" says she. "Business is elegant!
With so many officers in town, I can
scarcely keep enough things in stock. The
beaded georgettes go so fast, on account of
being perishable. Ruby Roselle had three last
week of me. One party and they're gone!"</p>

<p>While Masie and me has been friends ever
since I can remember, her mother having been
Lady Lion Tamer in the same circus with Ma
and Pa's trapeze act, as she uttered them
words, I commenced feeling a little coolness
toward her. For once I get a idea in my
head it's a religion to me, and the W.S.S. was
getting to me.</p>

<p>"Dont you think maybe that's profiteering,
Masie?" I ast.</p>

<p>Maison run a well manicured hand over her
marcelle and smiled superior&mdash;she has always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
prided herself on being sort of high-brow and
reads <i>Sappy Stories</i> regular.</p>

<p>"Why, dearie, how you talk!" she says.
"Dont you know that a little gaiety keeps up
the morale of the country?"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure about some gaiety keeping
up the moral of anything!" I says with
meaning, not wishing to directly knock anybody
but still wishing Masie to get me. "And
personally myself, I think any time's a bad
time to waste money on clothes which won't
last!"</p>

<p>"My goodness, Sweetie!" Masie shrieked.
"What's gonner become of us if ladies was to
quit buying? Tell me that? How we gonner
hire our help, and all, and how can they live
if we dont hire 'em? Have a heart!" she says.
"And what are you talking about&mdash;you coming
in after a new dress yourself, and only last
week had two chiffons which Gawd knows
ain't chain-armour for wear!"</p>

<p>"I know!" I admitted, "but I'm going to can
my order. Just tell the girl to bring gingham
or something which will wash&mdash;if you got such
a thing!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mary Gilligan, I guess you're going
nutty!" says Masie, but she gives the order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and I choose one at $15&mdash;which could be dry-cleaned,
and that was the nearest I could come
to what I was after.</p>

<p>"You wont like it!" Masie warned me. "It's
too cheap&mdash;better take a good silk!"</p>

<p>But I wouldn't&mdash;not on a bet. Even although
what Masie said about cutting down
too much on buying stuff sounded sensible, or
would if only the question was how far can
a person cut before they reach the quick? Of
course I see her point, and she had as good a
right to live as me. Yet something was wrong
some place, I couldn't figure out where. So I
just charged the dress and set out for home,
and owning a cotton dress made me feel awful
warlike and humble&mdash;do you get me?</p>

<p>But while I felt better about my dress, the
cream-cakes was still with me, and, being now
a sort of Government Official, they and that
got me noticing the food signs, as well, and
wishing I had eat only a little cereal for my
lunch. That gave me a idea which on arriving
home I handed to Ma.</p>

<p>"I have just bought me a wash-dress, or almost
so, Ma!" I told her. "And honest to
Gawd I do think we ought to eat to match it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Suppose we was to go on war-rations of our
own free wills?"</p>

<p>"Well, we eat pretty plain and wholesome
now!" says Ma. "Just like we always done!"</p>

<p>"But times is different!" I says, toying with
the soda-mint bottle, and who knows but what
they were being more needed abroad? "And
cream-cakes is a non-essential. Especially to
one which has to keep her figure down," I says.
"So for lunch to-morrow let's have cereal
only," I says.</p>

<p>Well I hate to take pleasure from any one
and the sight of Ma's face when I said this
would of brought tears to a glass eye. But
I felt particularly strong-minded just then
what with the indigestion and no letter from
the censor yet and Gawd knows that is no joke
as they are certainly more his than Jim's by
the time they get to me! But after I had told
Ma how all the caviar had ought to be sent
over to the boys and how food would win the
war and how Wilson expected every man&mdash;you
know&mdash;well, she got all enthusiastic over
making up a lot of cheap recipes and we had the
butcher and grocer pared down to about ninety
cents each per day. Ma could just see herself
growing slim, and she kept remembering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
things she used to cook for Pa in the old days
before she retired on the insurance money.
And first thing you knew the time had come
for me to go to the theatre. Just as I was
starting for the door Ma mentioned Rosco,
our publicity man.</p>

<p>"Are you going to call him or will I?" she
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"About what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why about your committee-meeting to-morrow?"
she says.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing!" I came back at her.
"Would you invite a manager to see a practice-act?
Its going to be amateur-night for me, to-morrow
is, and no outsiders are urged to attend!
And anyways, I'm not doing this for
publicity which Gawd knows I dont need any,
but for my Uncle Sam!"</p>

<p>"Well, thank goodness, you aint go no other
relations you feel that way about," says Ma,
"or we'd all be in the poorhouse shortly!"</p>


                   <h3>III</h3>

<p>Well, that night when I came home I cried
myself to sleep with my head under the pillow
so's Ma wouldn't hear what I called the censor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
but slept good on account of the simple
little war-supper of only lettuce and a cup of
soup which Ma had ready for me, and in the
morning was up with the lark as the poet says,
only of course they was really sparrows, it being
the city. Well, anyways, I felt good and
husky and as early as eleven-thirty I was all
fixed up in the new wash dress, which its a actual
fact Musette had to sew it together four
separate places that it come apart while putting
it on me. The goods wasn't the quality I
had thought, come to look at them closer, but
anyways it was cheap and that was one good
thing about it. Ma brought me in a shredded
wheat-less biscuit and a cup of coffee, a sort of
funny look on her face like she had taken her
oath and would stick it out to the death. She
didn't say anything, only set it down and I ate
it, saying nothing either because it was what
we had agreed we would get along on for
breakfast. When I was through she give me
a news item.</p>

<p>"The cook is leaving!" she says. "On account
of the new rations."</p>

<p>"That's no loss!" I says gaily, because as a
general thing Ma is only too glad when this
happens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"I ain't so sure!" says Ma. "I'm not as
young as I was, and I cant do <i>all</i> the cooking!"</p>

<p>Well&mdash;believe you me&mdash;I sat up and took
notice of that! Ma kicking at her favorite
pastime. Something was wrong. But even
then I didn't get what it was. So I just remarked
we could eat our dinners at the Ritz
that being good publicity anyways and always
expected of me in full evening dress when I
am dancing. So that much settled and there
being no letter yet and me being sort of nervous
about that meeting which was breaking
ahead, I went and beguiled a hour at Jim's
souvenir. I thought a whole lot of that
pianola, he having given it to me just before
he sailed, and as of course it was too heavy to
wear over my aching heart which is generally
supposed to be done with souvenirs of loved
ones overseas, I put in a good deal of time sitting
at it, and&mdash;believe you me&mdash;my touch is
a whole lot better than Ma's which me being
light on my feet by nature and business both,
is not so surprising. Well, I got myself all
worked up over Jim while playing "Somewhere
A Voice Is Calling with Mandolin Arrangement"
and a whole lot of expression and
what with feeling a little low on account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
patriotic breakfast, I was just in the right
frame of mind to throw myself heart and soul
into the good work before me&mdash;do you get it?
You do!</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Well, I had no sooner left the shelter of our
own flat, than that same hold-up game which
I had noticed so particular the day before was
started on me. The elevator-girls, which had
taken the place of a standing yet sitting army
of foreign princes which had used to clutter
up our front hall and the only excuse they had
for living was the nerve they give the landlord
when he come to price the rents:&mdash;well, anyways,
the girls which had taken their places
since the draft blew in, was selling W.S.S.
Of course I couldn't buy any for the same reasons
as yesterday. So they sprung a working
girls War Crippled Aid Fund and I contributed
to that, because I believe in girls running
elevators. Why wouldn't they, when
thousands has run dumb-waiters so good for
years? Well, anyways, I give them something
and escaped to the street only to be lit on for
stamps by the first small boy I met. And
after only seven others had tried me, I got to
the Palatial Hotel, and&mdash;believe you me&mdash;by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
that time worried pretty severely about how
could a person sell twenty-five thousand dollars
worth of the pesky things and not get slain
by some impatient citizen who felt that I was
the last camel and his back was broke, or whatever
the poet says? Really, it was serious, and
being the first of the Theatrical Ladies to arrive,
the big ballroom with the table and seven
empty chairs like a desert island in the middle
of the floor, failed to cheer me any.</p>

<p>Well, there was a arm-chair at one end of
the table and there being nobody around to
either elect me or stop me, I grabbed off this
chair and held to it with the grim expression
of a suburbanite who knows her husband isn't
coming but wont admit it, and a good thing I
acted prompt as should be done in all war-measures,
because pretty soon the other ladies
commenced arriving. I guess they must of
thought they could get a better part by coming
early, they was so prompt, and by one
o'clock they was actually all there except Pattie
and her unknown friend, which was pretty
good, the date having been twelve-thirty.</p>

<p>Well, we all shook hands and I arose from
my seat but didn't move a inch away from it,
having seen something of committee meetings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
where the wrong person had it. And then
they all sat down and took in my dress and
hat and I theirs, and we was very amiable and
refined and I felt so glad I had picked such a
good bunch and wished Pattie would hurry so's
we could commence, when lo! as the poet says,
my wish was granted, for in come Pattie and
with her her friend and My Gawd, if it wasn't
Ruby Roselle!</p>

<p>Well, far be it from me to say anything
about any lady, only pro-Germans is pro-Germans
by any other name, as Shakespeare says,
provided you can find it out, and here she was,
butting in on a gathering of would-be Dolly
Madisons and Moll Pritchers and everything,
and I wouldn't of invited her for the world
if only Pattie had mentioned her name. But
here she was, all dressed up like a plush horse
and so friendly it got me worried right away.
Any one which has seen Ruby in her red, white
and blue tights will at once realize what I
mean, though nothing but the tights was ever
proved against her. What on earth she wanted
with our committee was very suspicious because
why would she ever of taken a expensive and
difficult present like a baby alligator from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
German which she once done, if not pro, her
own self?</p>

<p>But time for starting something had sure
come, if we was ever to get any lunch, so I
got them all seated and commenced&mdash;a little
weak in the knees which it was a good thing I
was seated, but strong in the voice, so as to
start the moral right&mdash;do you get me?</p>

<p>"Ladies of the Theatrical Ladies W.S.S.
Committee," I began, being determined not to
waste no time on formalities, which it has always
seemed to me that on such occasions a
lot of gas is used up in them which would have
run the machine quite a ways if applied properly.
We all knew we was the Theatrical
Ladies W.S.S. Committee and I was the
chairman, so why waste words making me it?
"Ladies," I says, "I have a letter from President
Wilson asking me to get to work, and so
have formed a committee to sell twenty-five
thousand dollars worth of War Savings
Stamps on the first of the month. I sat right
down and wrote him I would do it, and here we
are. Of course this being the twenty-eighth
of the month the notice is short. Probably he
didn't expect us really to get to work until next
month, but personally, myself, I think we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
should surprise him by getting the money by
Saturday night, which Saturday night is the
first. Now, you Committee Ladies is here to
discuss how will we do it. I would be glad to
hear ideas, suggestions and etc."</p>

<p>Well, nobody said anything for a few minutes
only Ruby put a little powder on her nose
and looked at it critical in her vanity case
mirror, which well she might for Gawd knows
she had powder enough on her already. Then
Madame Broun, the Lady Baritone, cleared
her throat.</p>

<p>"I would be glad to give a recital," she said,
swelling up her neatly upholstered black satin
bosom, "and turn over the money it brings in.
I presume the Government would hire the
theatre for me."</p>

<p>"Well," I says, "that is a real nice suggestion
only not quite practical. You see it wouldn't
be right to ask the Government to pay for the
theater in case it was a wet Monday and only
a few came in out of the rain. Any more
ideas?"</p>

<p>The blond Dahlia sister spoke up then.</p>

<p>"Whatever you suggest goes with me,
Marie," she says, which was terrible sweet of
her, only it's a darn sight easier to give a proxy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
than a good suggestion, which I did not however
mention, Blondie being a real fine Jewish
American and a willing worker as I well knew.</p>

<p>"I thought of course it was a benefit we
would give," put in Pattie in a voice which
just plain dismissed every other possibility. "I
have a new patter to 'Yankee Doodle' with a
red, white and blue spot on me, at front center
with the rest of the house dark. It ought to
go big about the center of the programme."</p>

<p>After which modest little suggestion she
sunk gracefully back into her seat and commenced
shadow-tapping the tune with her feet
under the committee table.</p>

<p>"Well, benefits is always possible," I said,
"and of course we could have it with admission
by W.S.S. only. But it's been done a lot and
three days ain't so very much time in which to
get it up in a way which would do your act
justice," I says.</p>

<p>"Ah! <i>cheries!</i>" says Mlle. DuChamp. "Mes
petites!" she says, whatever that was. "I have
zee gran' idea&mdash;perfect! I will make zee
speach on zee steps of zee Library of zee Public
at Forty-Second Street and Feeth Avenoo.
I will arise, I will stretch my han', I will call
out 'Cityonnes! 'Urry up queek! Your countree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
call you&mdash;Formez vos battillions!' and
while I make zee dramatic appeal zee ozzers
can collect twenty-five t'ousand dollar from zee
breathless crowd!"</p>

<p>She had got up on her box-toed shoes and
was making the grandest gestures you ever see.
Honest to Gawd I do believe that girl has
herself kidded into believing that the Paris she
was born in was France, not Ind. I kind of
waved at her, and when she had flopped back
into her place, completely overcome by her
emotions, I suggested that maybe the Library
wasn't as Public as it looked, being generally
occupied of a fine afternoon by wounded soldiers
making the same line of talk, and of
course Mlle. DuChamps would be more <i>chic</i>
and all that, but would she be let?</p>

<p>"Of course she wouldn't!" says Ruby, coming
out of her vanity-case for a minute. "Of
course not! My idea is that we all chip in say
about seven thousand five hundred and let it
go at that!"</p>

<p>Somehow this cheap-Jack way of getting
out of doing any work by spending a little
money, got my goat something fierce. Besides
which it was Ruby's idea of patriotism and all
against W.S.S. rules and everything, but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the minute I was so floored I couldn't speak.
The dark Dahlia did it for me, though, and
much more contained than I could of at the
time.</p>

<p>"That's mighty generous, Miss Roselle," she
says just as sweet, "only you see me and Blondie
has each got our thousand dollars worth
and one person can't get more," she says.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll take a thousand dollars worth
then," said Ruby, and I could see very plain
that the matter was finished in her mind, and
what would you expect different after them patriotic
tights of hers?</p>

<p>"I'll take a thousand also," put in Madame
Broun. "To tell the right truth I haven't a
one. What do you do with them&mdash;stick them
on the backs of letters like Tuberculosis, or
Merry Xmas?"</p>

<p>Well, we explained they was not a additional
burden to the postman but more or less of a
investment. And then the awful truth come
out that Pattie hadn't none either and that
Mlle. DuChamps had always thought they was
to put on tobacco boxes and candy and everything
you stored up in the house to eat, though
Gawd only knows how she got that idea except
of course it's the truth that most people is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
boobs, outside of their own line, more's the
pity!</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Well, anyways, we took in four thousand
right then and there and so all that remained
was twenty-one. Ruby undertook to sell
another three among her personal friends, and
the Dahlias said they thought they could raise
as much more between theirselves. Then
when Mlle. DuChamps and Madame Broun
had concluded to take on three apiece there
was eleven thousand dollars worth of friendless
little stamps with nobody to love them but me.
Well, with no better schemes than benefits and
concerts and talks in sight, I see it was up to
me to bite off the biggest slice of pie myself,
so I said I'd take the remainder. Of course
with my influence and name and all I would of
had no trouble getting rid of them only by
asking prominent men like Goldringer and
Rosco and the Dancing Trust people beside a
few more personal ones. And then when we
had got this far I see some of the ladies commence
looking at their wrist-watches for other
reasons than to show they had them, and so
hustled up the last of the business which was
merely how would we print our forms for subscribers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
to fill out. Ruby suggested a gilt-edge
card tinted violet with whatever lettering
I chose, and while I didn't care for it I agreed,
being hungry myself.</p>

<p>"I do think it is awful fine of you to take
on that big amount," said Pattie. "But you
always was generous, Marie, I will say that
for you."</p>

<p>"Ladies!" I said. "No thanks where they
dont belong. Because I am undertaking this
sale for far other reasons than you suppose."</p>

<p>But since everybody by then plainly cared
more for their lunch than my reasons we
parted, agreeing to send the money to my place
on Sunday morning.</p>


                  <h3>IV</h3>

<p>But I will here set down my unspoken reasons,
which was that fine as it is to walk out to
your rich friends and pluck a thousand worth
of stamps per each off them and of course nobody
but thinks the rich should have them, too,
I had a strong hunch that the reason for selling
stamps at five dollars or even two bits, was because
every one could get in on a good thing
that way. Somehow there seemed something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
too up-stage about going in only for the high
spots, and after ordering the cards I hurried
home full of determination to make a stab at
selling to the common herd and with a terrible
appetite and anxious as could be over the one
o'clock mail.</p>

<p>Well, the last two was doomed to a immediate
disappointment because the censor was
sitting just as tight as ever and there was only
cereal for lunch. Believe you me it give me
sort of a jolt when I sat down to so little and
Ma's face was not any too cheering. We commenced
to eat in silence which being both perfect
ladies was the only thing to do as it was
also burned. But after a minute Ma lay down
on the job. She pushed her dish over toward
me in disgust.</p>

<p>"Try that on your piano, Mary Gilligan!"
she says.</p>

<p>"Well, Ma, you know what war is," I says.
"And we'll get a good meal at the Ritz to-night
to make up!"</p>

<p>Well, anyways, sustained more by patriotism
than by what I had eat, I set out to put
over a scheme I had all hatched out in my head
for using places which was already kind of organized,
as my selling agents&mdash;do you get me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
And the first place I went was to Maison Rosabelle's
because&mdash;believe you me&mdash;that cheap
dress I had bought off her needed a plastic surgeon
by then. Maison was as usual giving
a unconscious imitation of a trained seal,
switching gracefully around the store with a
customer which she was hypnotizing into all
forgetfulness of prices. But finally I got her
alone long enough to express what I thought
about the dress and any lady will be able to
imagine what that was. Then I asked her
could she fall in with my scheme which was on
Saturday to take only Thrift Stamps or
W.S.S. for each purchase and sell them the
stamps herself. Maison didn't enthuse over
the idea, though she's rich at that.</p>

<p>"Why, dearie! Not on a bet!" she said.
"It ain't that I'm not patriotic, but this establishment
is <i>exclusive!"</i></p>

<p>Well, I seen there was no use arguing with
her, and I guess there never is with a woman
which is marcelle-waved every day of her life,
not to mention that cheap fake of a dress.
Next one I buy of her without a guarantee will
be for her funeral! So I just left her flat and
went over to Chamberlin's. Of course it takes
a whole lot more brains to run a enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
cabaret and restaurant like his than Maison
has to use if less nerve, he not coming personally
into contact with the customers like she
does, and I counted on this. I went in by the
main door where a lady sat selling W.S.S.
and she bored me to death with them while a
captain went to find Chamberlin. When I
seen him coming I tried to assume that
sprightly and convincing manner of the sidewalk
W.S.S. hounds, but was overcome with
that deep seated sense of being about to make
a flivver, which also shows on most of them.
However, Chamberlin was a genial good soul
and was crazy over stamps. But he had beat
me to it on the admission only by buying
stamps on Saturday night.</p>

<p>"Better try among your rich friends, Miss
La Tour!" he says. "And you'll be surprised
how many you'll sell. That's the easiest way
unless you use a gun!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to sell to my friends," says I.
"I want to sell to everybody&mdash;get folks to chip
in. The chipping-in idea is what is so good&mdash;get
together and all that."</p>

<p>Well, believe you me&mdash;after this I tried a
dozen places and every one of them, stores and
all, where I had any influence or charge account,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
had got theirselves so full of W.S.S.
schemes that I felt like a helpless babe in arms
as the poet says, before I was through. There
was no room for my little $11,000 worth any
place: they had all stocked up, and what to do
next I had no idea.</p>

<p>On the way to the Ritz that night Ma didn't
talk steady like she usually does and seemed
kind of low in her mind, and maybe in her
stomach also which I was the same by then.
Not to mention the censor which it is better not
to for fear I might say what I thought and he
a Government official.</p>

<p>But anyways no sooner was we inside the
hotel than two society swells tackled us for
W.S.S. Oh, they was democratic, just! They
spoke right to us, and everything! But my
goat was got by it.</p>

<p>"A regular hold-up!" I whispered to Ma.
And as I spoke them fateful words I remembered
that I owned a gun, which it was left
from a piece I done for the movies and I had
kept it for a souvenir. Of course I dismissed
the thought at once like the sensible woman
I am. But somehow it wouldn't exactly stay
away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Did you ever get to seeing things as they
really was and wondering why on earth people
go through such a lot of motions pretending
things is not what they seem, as some guy so
truly says&mdash;do you get me? As soon as I had
said "hold-up" I realized that that was just
what was being done. And when I realized
that it was <i>necessary</i> to hold up people in order
to get them to make a safe investment which
would earn them a good net profit while saving
their fool lives, I got so raving mad that
a gun seemed too good for them. And mad at
myself, too, for not seeing sooner how much
my own Jim's welfare was hanging onto my
shoulders. Somehow up to then I had really
a idea that the bunch down in Washington was
relieving me of all trouble and responsibility
about this war. But now I seen it wasn't so.
If the G.A.P. or Great American People was
actually such boobs that they didn't flock up
and wish their life savings onto such a scheme,
they had ought to be made to, same as Ma used
to hold my nose for my own good and believe
you me&mdash;I can taste that oil to this day!</p>

<p>Well, anyways, this philosophy stuff kept
going through my mind while running up a
considerable check which Gawd knows we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
needed it or the undertaker would of conscripted
us. And then all of a sudden who did
I see but Ruby Roselle only two tables away
and with her a husky young lounge-lizzard
which goes around with her a lot&mdash;you know&mdash;one
of the kind whose favorite flower is the
wild oat, but never has anything to spend but
the evening. And him and Ruby had their
heads together and was watching me like the
German spies in a movie which every one in
the audience spots except their victims which
of course are looking at the director close up
front which is certainly the only reason they are
fooled.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, I was surprised to see Ruby
because Broadway places is more her speed,
and I never see her in such refined surroundings
before. But I realizing about her kind
of patriotism I commenced wondering wasn't
she there to watch me? Though for what reason
I had no idea.</p>

<p>That night after the show, I asked Goldringer
wouldn't he use the admission by W.S.S.
Saturday, and he wouldn't because he had it
on for one of his other theatres. And so I
went home in despair and a taxi, and was further
cheered by a empty letter-box.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning the cards come&mdash;a thousand
of them&mdash;and certainly more elegant looking
than I had expected, I will say that for Ruby
and reading as follows:</p>

<p>"The Theatrical Ladies W.S.S. Committee
will deliver to ............ of ............
worth of W.S.S. stamps on presentation of this
card. Payment for same is hereby acknowledged."</p>

<p>Then came a blank which it was up to me
to fill in. Well, I didn't hesitate and after a
hearty breakfast of crackers and milk and
weak tea, I tied up the lace sleeves of my negligee
and set to work at signing them. Believe
you me, before I was done I quite see why
President Wilson used a rubber stamp! But
I didn't weaken until noon, when any one
would have on the meal I'd had. And by then
they was finished anyways and every one of
them valid and as good as my cheque. Then
just as I was feeling proud of myself in come
Ma and I could see at once she was going to
take a fall out of me in her sweet womanly
way.</p>

<p>"If you ain't too busy with your war work,"
says Ma very gentle but firm, "I'd like to talk
to you about something before we set down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the skeleton lunch which is waiting and can
be continued in our next for all I care!" she
says.</p>

<p>Well, I got that gone-around-the-middle
feeling which I always get when Ma gives me
a certain look, just like I used to when she'd
tell me soap was good for washing out the
mouths of kids which had told a lie. And so
I just set there and listened.</p>

<p>"Now, Mary Gilligan," she commenced.
"Do you know the size of the cheque you signed
over to the hotel last night?"</p>

<p>"About twelve-fifty," I says sort of getting
a glimmer.</p>

<p>"When your Pa and me was married he give
me twelve a week for all our meals!" she says,
and set back and folded her hands in a way
which said all she hadn't.</p>

<p>"But times has changed," I says sort of
feeble.</p>

<p>"But appetites has not!" says Ma. "And
how can you keep in good training on this war-nonsense?"
she wanted to know. "Not to mention
me, which it might improve my figure but
never my disposition?"</p>

<p>"But how about making war sacrifices and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
all, Ma?" I says. "Jim ain't eating like we
done up till yesterday!"</p>

<p>"Nor he ain't eating twelve dollar dinners at
the Ritz, neither," she reminds me, at which of
course I shut up and she went on. "Now I
dont believe being stingy to ourselves is really
gonner help the war. You have strode in
upon my department for once, Mary Gilligan,
and I'm going to put you out! You don't
know where to economize and I do. No more
eating out, and a good sensible table at home,
minus cream cakes," she says, "is what we do
from now on!"</p>

<p>And with that she marches out leaving me
flat as one of her own pan-cakes. Well, this
was bad enough, but when Musette got after
me as I was dressing to go for my five miles,
I seen that my humbling for the day was not
finished.</p>

<p>"That dress Madam bought yesterday," she
began.</p>

<p>"You can have it!" I said, beating her to it,
or so I thought.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I do not care for it," says
Musette. "I was just remarking it is really
not fit to wear again. Madam would of done
better to pay a little more!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Can you beat it? You can not! Two falls
from one pride! Believe you me I took <i>some</i>
walk that afternoon, and if I had wore a speedomiter
I bet it would have registered a lot over
five miles. And while I was walking I kept
getting madder and madder and more and
more worked up over what boneheads people
was and how was a person to economize nowadays
and how on earth would I sell all them
stamps by Saturday night with a matinée in
between and keep my promise to President
Wilson? It begun to look like I was going to
have to become one of them sidewalk pests. I
got a real good picture of myself going up to
the proud or pesky passer-by, and getting
turned down so often that my spirit was bent
thinking of it.</p>

<p>But&mdash;believe you me&mdash;I made up my mind
that if I had to hold up anybody to make
them invest in the World's Soundest Securities
or W.S.S. I would hold them up good and
plenty and no disguise about it. I thought
again about my revolver, the one which I had
used it in the movies when I done "The
Dancer's Downfall" for them and kept it for
a souvenir. I was that wrought up over the
situation that by the time I got home I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
pretty near decided I'd take that fire-arm to
the theatre and lock the doors and come down
front center and shoot out one of the lights to
show I meant it and then take the money right
off the audience. The theatre being my native
element it seemed only natural to pull the trick
there, only being a lady the gun really did look
a little rough only not more so than the public
deserved.</p>


                       <h3>V</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Well</span>, anyways, I was certainly up against
it with all them blanks still on my hands and no
way in sight of getting rid of them. And just
to make things nice and pleasant, what do I see
when I come on the stage that night but Ruby
Roselle and her pet lounge-lizzard which were
sitting in a box. She certainly seems to go in
for reptiles for pets. And no sooner did I get
off after my eighth curtain call, than around
she comes to my dressing room and hands me a
check for her stamps and for the ones she had
undertaken to sell and already had.</p>

<p>"I suppose yours is all sold too!" says Ruby.
"You are so efficient, dearie!"</p>

<p>"Oh, mine are all right!" I snapped. "Or
will be by this time to-morrow."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, ain't they gone?" she cooed. And
did I wish for my gun? I did! "Ain't you
give any of them cards out yet?" she says.</p>

<p>"No!" I says. "But I will&mdash;I'll commence
with you, dear Miss Roselle," I says. "And
here you are"&mdash;and I filled out the receipt
cards which I had a few in my vanity case for
emergencies, and give them to her. When she
took them I noticed she had a awful funny look
in her eye, but at the time it meant nothing to
me. Alas! Would I had heeded it more&mdash;but
no&mdash;solid ivory! Solid ivory! I passed it up
completely. And Ruby grabbed the cards,
collected her new pet animal, and went away.</p>

<p>Well, my state of mind that night was distinctly
poor, even after the nice little well-ballanced
war-ration of hot chocolate and corn
bread with brown sugar which Ma had for me
and delicious as anything you ever ate if she
did get the recipe out of a newspaper and they
so unreliable nowadays. But no letter from
Jim, and so after I had asked Ma if she
thought it was right to wear black, I went to
bed and fell into a exhausted sleep which
lasted well on toward the box-office man's
afternoon on, because Ma always lets me sleep
late when I have to dance twice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, anyways, I was so rushed getting to
the theatre for the matinée that I hadn't no
time to try any of that sidewalk stuff, only I
did get a cheque from each of the other committee
members and told Ma to send them receipt
cards. And did I feel cheap? I <i>did!</i>
A flivver, that was what I had made. But
so long as Jim was surely dead by now, I didn't
care for myself. Only my promise to Mr.
Wilson made a lump in my throat while doing
my three hand-springs and the "Valse Superb,"
which shows how bad I felt. And what
do you know, when I took my encore, there was
Ruby Roselle again, down in front and all
alone.</p>

<p>This got about the last butt out of my goat
and I sent an usher to get her, but Ruby had
went before the usher had made up her mind
to undertake the mission. I was just about
wild all the way home, and the sight of Ma's
face when I got there almost made me cry it
was that sweet and friendly. Honest to Gawd
when Ma has got her own way about anything
she is just lovely to be with! And having
got the kitchen back and the grandest dish of
baked beans all full of molasses and salt pork
for dinner, she was feeling fine and I was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
same under her influence and even let her play
"Sing Me to Sleep" with the loud pedal on
Jim's souvenir afterwards and never said a
word to her about it, though suffering while I
listened. And then it was time to go back to
the theatre and I took Musette and that whole
box of gilt edged securities which seemed no
good to nobody, but I took them, and a good
yet bad thing I did, for on the way downtown
I decided what to do, and when I got there,
called the ushers and gave them instructions
and a little something else by way of promoting
kindly feelings. And then with beating
heart I beat it for the dressing room and commenced
rubbing on my make-up cream with
trembling fingers.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>Did you ever make one of them critical decisions
which you knew in your heart you was
actually going to carry it through and no
camouflage, even if it killed you and it very
likely to? Well, when I decided to make a
speech right out in public I got that feeling&mdash;do
you get me? And any Elk or other lodge
member which attends annual banquets will
know what I mean. Honest to Gawd I nearly
missed my cue, and after I finally got on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
stage the dance I did must of been either automatic
or a inspiration and I don't know why
they liked it out in front, but they did. All I
personally myself could hear was "Ladies and
Gentleman, I want to speak a word to you,"&mdash;You
know! And hand-springs in between!
Well of course when I come out for my first
encore I didn't have the wind to say nothing&mdash;But
my eyes was as good as ever and there in
a box was Ruby Roselle again!</p>

<p>Believe you me&mdash;that was a jolt and a half!
Here she had come to give me the laugh I had
no doubt, and somehow after the second call
my wind was all of a sudden back good and
strong, and with it came my courage. For I
wouldn't of been downed by her, not for anything!</p>

<p>So stepping foreward in a modest manner
I held up my hand and the house got quiet
and listened. As I have said, the show was at
the Spring Garden, and it's awful big and I
had never knew how full of silence it could be
until I heard the sound of my own voice all
alone in it. But after a minute I got used to
it, and so interested in trying to convince the
folks, that I didn't care.</p>

<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen," I says. "This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
going to be a plain, good old-fashioned hold-up!
If you listen hard, maybe you'll hear the
screams of the women and children, and the
groans of the wounded pocket-books! Far be
it from me to do anything so unrefined as to
actually use a gun on you," I says, "but I'm
going to do the next thing to it. I'm going
to sell eleven thousand dollars worth of W.S.S.
right here and now, and you are going to buy
them. I know all of you has probably been
buying them all day and is sick of them, but I
have personally promised President Wilson to
do as much by to-night without fail and you
must help me make good. And no matter how
many you have bought," I says, "unless you
have a thousand dollars worth you can spend
another ten or so apiece. Now, as I say, I
know this is a hold-up, because it is meant to
be. And any public which can sit here in a
theatre and feel anoyed at having to buy a few
stamps when a million of our boys is over in
far-away, sort of unreal France, giving their
lives, had ought to have a machine gun turned
on them from this stage instead of a line of
talk! Probably this is the first time in the
history of finances that it has been necessary
to jolly a crowd into making a good investment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
If I was selling stock in a fake gold
mine," I says, "you would probably be climbing
on the stage to get it! Now will everybody
willing to take ten dollars worth kindly stand
up?"</p>

<p>There was a few laughs, and a few people
got up here and there, sort of shamefaced.</p>

<p>"Come on!" I says. "Come on&mdash;are you
all cripples? You over there&mdash;only ten dollars&mdash;save
it on next months grocery bill&mdash;all
right&mdash;save it on your auto bill!"</p>

<p>A few more got up then, but not nearly
enough and I caught sight of Goldringer in
the wings by then and not having warned him
what I was going to do, I could tell by his expression
that I mustn't hold the stage too long
or a militaristic system would right away be
born in our theatre. So I got desperate.</p>

<p>"No more!" I called. "Oh, come on get up!
Will I send for crutches, or are you only shy?
Remember, I got that money promised! Only
ten dollars each!"</p>

<p>But no more stirred. For a minute I
thought my flivver was complete, and then I
got a idea. I went over and beckoned to
George, the orchestra leader, and shaking all
over at my own nerve, I whispered to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
George grinned and passed along the whisper
to his crew, and in another minute that audience
was standing, every last one of them, and&mdash;believe
you me&mdash;the Star Spangled Banner
had never sounded so good to me before!</p>

<p>Well, anyways, my pep all come back and I
jumped off the stage as I see the ushers
couldn't possibly handle the orders alone, and
wait or no wait, the way that audience took
my hold-up was something grand, it was that
good natured, although of course a Broadway
crowd gets sort of hardened to having their
money taken away from them roughly. They
was lambs, and took cards so fast I couldn't
have shuffled them good if it had been a game.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, when I finally got back to
my dressing-room and the trained animals had
come on at last&mdash;believe you me&mdash;I was all in,
but not a card left, and not alone eleven thousand
dollars but thirteen-fifty in actual cash!
I didn't worry none about having too much as
I never see a committee yet which couldn't use
more money than it had ast for, the White
Kittens always having a deficit. And then I
just put the boodle away safe in my tin make-up
box which I had emptied because it locked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
good, and took me and Musette and it home
to Ma.</p>

<p>Well, that was about all for that, and I had
a fine sleep that night after sending the President
a wire telling him I had the money all
right. And if only the censor had loosened
up, I would have been perfectly happy, with
all that cash in my little Burglar's Delight
over the mantle-piece and a good real energy-making
breakfast coming to me in the morning.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But alas for false security, as the poet says.
No sooner had Ma and me ate breakfast next
morning than in came Musette and says there
are two gentlemen outside wants to see me.
Well, it seems they wouldn't give their names
so I says show them in for on account of Ma
always making us dress in real clothes for
breakfast Sundays, it was alright.</p>

<p>Well, in come two gentlemen then, and it
was easy to see one was a cop. Why he didn't
have green whiskers or something I dont know
because the one citizen you can always spot is
a cop, and that tweed suit was no disguise, although
he seemed to think so. I got a awful
funny feeling in my stomach at this sight although
there was nothing on my mind but my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
hair pins. The other was a gentleman and no
disguise about him, and I sort of took to him
right away and dropped my society-comedy
manner which is such a good weapon of defense
against strangers because I knew right
away he would see through it on account of him
being the real thing.</p>

<p>"Miss LaTour?" he says politely.</p>

<p>"Yes," I says, "what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Alias Mary Gilligan?" says the cop, which
was right in character and hadn't ought to of
got Ma's goat like it done.</p>

<p>"Alias nothing!" says Ma. "Gilligan is
her right name and you can see my marriage
certificate and the date is on it plain!"</p>

<p>"Better leave this to me for a moment,
O'Rourke," says the nice gentleman, about
Pa's age, he must have been. Then he turns
to me while the cop took a back seat.</p>

<p>"Miss LaTour," the gent. began, "I am
one of the local W.S.S. committee&mdash;Pioneer
Division&mdash;Pierson Langton is my name. And
I have come to see you concerning your sale
last night!"</p>

<p>Well&mdash;believe you me&mdash;the minute I heard
his name I had him spotted! One of the F. F.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
V's of N.Y. and I had often seen his name in
the paper with war-work and all.</p>

<p>"Do sit down, both!" I says real cordial.
"I am so glad to see you! It's kind of you
to come, because of course I was going to bring
you the money the first thing in the morning!
Just wait till I get my make-up box!"</p>

<p>And without giving him time to say another
word I hurried out and got it, the cop watching
me with his hand on his hip. When I
come back and give Mr. Langton the box and
key, he looked real surprised.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five thousand cash!" I says.
"Would you mind counting it?" He give me
one of the funniest looks I ever had handed out,
but he done like I asked. Then he got up, box
under one arm, and bowed, and sat down again.</p>

<p>"Miss LaTour," he said. "I think I win
a bet with our friend O'Rourke, here! I was
sure you were all right. Your reputation was
on the face of it too valuable for such an open
fraud. And your utter disingenuousness is
the final proof!"</p>

<p>"Fraud! What do you mean?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"There's been a complaint about your selling
W.S.S. without no authority!" says O'Rourke
at this. "Entered last night by Miss Ruby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Roselle. We got your cards here, that she
handed in. But you ain't got no stamps! I
dont know but what we ought to make a arrest,
Mr. Langton!"</p>

<p>"I will be obliged to you if you will let the
matter drop for the moment," says Mr. Langton.
"This young lady acted in good faith, I
am convinced. And now, Miss LaTour, perhaps
you will tell us how this all came about?"</p>

<p>Well, did I tell him? I did! I never told
anything readier. And then I took out the
President's letter which I had it on me, and
told how I had writ to him at once, partially
because I couldn't read the other fellows name.</p>

<p>"I accept the reproof," said Mr. Langton.
"I will get a rubber-stamp to-morrow!"</p>

<p>Then his eyes twinkled at me in the nicest
way, and I twinkled back, and after that I
knew the cop hadn't a chance of running me in,
which was a big relief, for my hands felt like
a couple of clams, about then, I was so scared.</p>

<p>"So you ain't mad?" I says to Mr. Langton.</p>

<p>"Not a bit!" he says. "I think it can all
be straightened out. But of course you understand
that what you did was a trifle&mdash;er&mdash;irregular.
If you will come down to headquarters
to-morrow and meet the members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
our board, we will be glad to assist you in forming
a more regular organization."</p>

<p>And I said I would, and then we all said
good-by real friendly, even the cop. And I
felt awful sort of excited and scared and glad
that Ruby had pulled that stuff, for if she
hadn't I might actually of gone to jail, I could
see that plain enough now! And so, to let off
a little steam when they had all gone I sat
down to my souvenir and started off "Over
There in Four Handed Arrangement." Then
just as I had got it going good, Ma, who was
reading the Sunday paper, gave a holler. I
turned around quick, and there her eyes was
popping out of her head and glued to the front
page.</p>

<p>"Jim!" she shrieked. "My Gawd!"</p>

<p>Well, how I reached that paper I don't
know, but somehow I did and there it was right
in the middle column.</p>

<blockquote><p>"American Dancer Now An Ace. James
La Tour Brings Down Three Enemy
Planes In One Afternoon."</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, my heavens! Didn't I yell, just! And
me knocking the newspapers and the censor.
And all the time Jim had been merely too busy
to write!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mary</span>:</p>

<p>Well say little one, I am certainly glad
your health, new contracts and the two
fool dogs is both doing so nicely and as for the
cigarettes they were O.K. not to say swell.
Only dearie, it ain't hardly necessary to have
my monogram on the next lot for Fritz has
never waited for me to catch up to him so's I
could offer him one and he's about the only
person would be impressed by the J. La T. because
our own boys kid me about any little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
thing like that on account of their knowing me
to be your dancing-partner and not to mention
husband and they are still slow to realize
that it takes a real he-man to swing you around
my neck twenty times like we do in the Tango
de Lux, and I have to continually keep showing
them.</p>

<p>Then another good reason for no gold monogram
is that the price of same would cover
quite a bunch of cheap smokes and dearie handing
them about is more to me than my own personal
vanity and would be the same with my
shirts if necessary, while over here in distant
Belgium I realise it was also a waste to have
them embroidered on the sleeve because the
dam chinaman always used to mark them up
with monograms of his own anyways.</p>

<p>Speaking of money we used to spend on un-essentials
before the war, I tell you dearie we
certainly learn in the army, especially since
getting into this recaptured territory, that
many objects we would have swore could not
be done without is laid off like the extra people
after the ball-room scene and nobody misses
them until somebody sends over one of them&mdash;like
them monogramed smokes of yours. Immediately
I got them I commenced to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
about little old B'way and dry-martinis and my
little old roadster with the purple body and the
red wheels, and us dancing at the palatial with
the juice full on us, red and green, violet and
amber. Oh Kid! it made me home-sick!! But
then we got a order to start on cleaning up
after them Botches again and so I forgot
everything but you and my new step&mdash;which
was forward, double line!</p>

<p>Well, sweetie, now about this smokes question.
Of course your Ma having been with
the circus is used to giving up things, as naturally
in a trapese-act such as hers used to be
she would need all the nerve she had and even
eating a welsh rabbit would of been a wild
party to her. The center ring is no joke and
forty feet above it on a trapese from the center
canvas less so. But trapese work has not
yet been offered to the Allies except mebbe
Itily on them mountains and any lady which
starts a society to keep smokes from soldiers
may be strong in morals but is surely weak in
the head, which I never knew your Ma to be
before. She being always not only a lady but
a great little picker on contracts and what
would we of done without her that time Goldringer
tried to slip the "satisfactory to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Goldringer Theatrical Productions Corp."
stuff over on us and she spotted it?</p>

<p>But for the love of liberty can this idea of
hers about it not being good for the boys to
smoke and make her quit worrying about us
tearing around France learning no new sins.
For sweetie the crimes a man can committ on
whats left of his pay after the alotment is took
out and the insurance and the liberty bonds
instalments would be sanctioned by anybody
in the country even if his coller buttoned up the
back. For take it or leave it, liquor, ladies
and lyrics is as expensive here as north of 42nd
str., and our pay dont go for them even after
distracting the above.</p>

<p>Why me and a fellow went off on leave to
a general store in a town which I couldn't spell
for you much less mention it, even if permitted.
But anyways we went to it and Mac
bought some winterweights and they was four-fifty
a pair and no better than the U.S. seventy-five
cent kind, and I got two pair socks a
dollar per each and two bananas for 25c, which
only goes to show everything here is terrible
expensive except nessessaties. So dont let your
Ma worry over me spending my remaining
nickel on vice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>I note what you say about the way folks at
home get your goat by passing the buck on
war-reliefs&mdash;if it's chocolet they say they've
just given to tobacco, if it's tobacco they just
bought a W.S.S., and if it's W.S.S. they
just got a hatful of bonds, or if it's bonds they
just give their last cent to chocolet&mdash;passing
the buck all along the line. Well dearie, I
guess mebbe that's their way of getting a little
war-relief of their own, but as you say why
would they need any relief when the fact that
they are for the most part without cooties ought
to be relief enough in itself? Let alone having
to dodge only taxi cabs and bill-collectors
instead of shells. Only of course we dont have
to do that now, only shell-holes, and dodge
them in a hurry to get one last look at the German
army before it puts on its good old soup
and fish&mdash;or whatever the German for civilized
clothing is, that is if they have any.</p>

<p>But you are right girlie, to boost the smokes.
We'll need them for a long while yet. I know
you have been obliged to keep your own from
your Ma and what with not really caring for
peppermints it has been hard all these years.
But while her trapeese work stood alone in its
day and no one on Broadway is more respected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
at this writing and as a mother-in-law I have
no complaint on her outside of her wearing
my dress-pumps, this one time she is dead
wrong. Soldiers are not always acrobats and
they do need to smoke and your Ma will put
herself in the small-time reform class if she
dont look out. When I think of the stuff I
seen up and down Broadway and elsewhere in
my days which could be reformed and no one
miss it, I get hot when I hear this talk about
keeping the army pure. Take it or leave it,
but the truth is the Huns has kept us pure
alright&mdash;they sweat all the wickedness out of
us running after them.</p>

<p>But to get back to the tobacco stuff. Dont
let nothing hinder you from bothering everybody
you see to send smokes. We'll use 'em
up never fear! And if you was to be walking
down the Avenue or mebbe Broadway sometime
and a box in your hand and asking for
Smoke Funds or something whichever way its
done&mdash;and your Ma was to fight her way
through the howling mob which would undoubtedly
be surrounding you on account of
course the best known parlor-dancing act in
America and the world wouldn't walk out looking
for funds and not draw a mob which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
only too glad to see you for five cents in the
smoke-fund-box instead of two dollars in the
box office&mdash;well, anyways, if your Ma was to
force her way through this mob which with her
weight she could do easily, why she would forgive
you in the end if not right there on the
street, and I believe that a hand-organ would
start and play hearts and flowers at that.</p>

<p>Anyways, keep up the good work only never
mind the monograms as long as they taste like
tobacco and can be lit. And if you fall out
with Ma just tell her this story which I will
tell you and she will see mebbe God didn't
put tobacco in the world merely for little slum
children to pluck on their two weeks vacation
in all its green beauty.</p>

<p>Well, the story is like this sweetie, and I will
write it as good as I can and if it seems comicle
go ahead and get a good laugh only take it
or leave it, it was no comedy at the time. But
if you was to news it around mebbe the folks
at home would start dropping something beside
coppers in them soda-fountain boxes you
was talking about, and commence trying to
squeeze a quarter through the slot now and
again. Come to think of it, the biggest thing
a copper penny can buy is the feeling a person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
gets from dropping one in a Belgium milk
bottle or home for crippled children or Merry
Xmas for the Salvation Army. You know
the cheap chest it gives you. Many a liberty
bond has been left in the Govts. hands by a
prospective buyer stumbling on a "drop a
penny" box in a cigar store on his way to the
cupon-cutters, or I miss my guess. I've done
the same in my day and the man who says he
aint raised his own stock with himself by giving
a nickle to the Newsboys Annual Outing is
as big a liar as the guy which says he never
loved another girl. And if pennies was to be
cut out of the currency a whole lot of cheap
philanthropists would have to make their conscience
work or fight.</p>

<p>Well, anyways you go right on boosting the
smoke-fund and never mind Ma. She'll learn
different some day.</p>

<p>Now about this story I was going to tell you.
First off leave me explain that the drinking
regulations over here is different to uniforms
than on the Rialto and America. I hunch it
that the managers and booking agents and so
forth in the U. S. Military Amusements Co.
inc. figure that a few of the rules have to be
let down while the big show is on. Same as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
stars can lean against a No Smoking sign on
the big time and roll a makin's quite openly.
So when on leave and even sometimes in the
dressing-room or I should say rest-billets a
bottle of wine is not out of order. Very different
sweetie, from the night Goldringer gave
me in my uniform the big send off at the Ritz
with all the newspaper bird and the leads and
everybody and me and you the only sober person
present, do you remember?</p>

<p>Well, its no news to you to say that I havent
forgot I am a professional dancer and good
condition is my middle name for my future, not
to mention my present contract with Uncle
Sam and that a sober man is worth more to
both&mdash;also to you and myself.</p>

<p>But the Allies dont look on liquor like we
do. As a matter of fact they seldom look on
what we would call liquor at all, hardly ever
getting a glympse of anything hard such as
rye, scotch or gin, and a cocktail being practically
a stranger and a repulsive one at that to
them. But wine is something different again.
Which while with us it is the high sign for a
big party and flowing only in extremely good
classes such as at the lobster layouts&mdash;leaving
aside dago spaghetti parlors when folks is resting&mdash;with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
them it is a common matter and
everybody drinks it and while there aint much
kick to it, still it has it all over the water we
get and coming under their idea of necessities,
is low in price. Of course by wine I do not
mean champagne like we used to for publicity
purposes order for our dinner in public, but
stuff made out of common grapes, I guess,
and with the seltzer left out.</p>

<p>Well, dearie, the reason I hand you all this
info. is that the story I am going to tell you got
started because of this wine. "In Venus Veritas"
you know or so they say, and I confess
that in trying to get a little kick out of the
stuff I got sort of lit and that's what caused
me the story.</p>


<h3>                     II</h3>

<p>Well, we was sort of waiting off stage as you
might call it, in a little town in Belgium, our
act having just been on and a pretty lively one
it was and the Captain give us a pretty good
hand on it, although as you know the audience
didn't wait for the finish but left us their orchestra
seats or front line trenches which we
moved into and then give up to the next number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
on the bill and come back to watch from
the wings, or would of only we was a little
too far off.</p>

<p>Well, the Capt. felt so good and the water
was so bad that he sent a delegation back for a
little liquid refreshment. They have big jugs
over here like the molasses is kept in at home
only here it is frankly boose and no one pretends
any different. And the game is this.
The one which volunteers for this dangerous
work, if broke himself, takes a swig or so out
of the jug he is bringing back which it dont
show on account of their not being transparent
and so the officer dont get any surprise until
toward the end of the jug and even so may
think he took more than he had thought. The
private will take only a little from each but if
there is jugs enough many a mickle makes
quite a jag.</p>

<p>Well, me and a fellow named McFarland
and a French kid called Ceasare was each given
two of these molasses jugs which looked like
props, and was sent off to a village some place
in congnito for you couldn't pronounce it.
And we was glad enough to go because among
other things we was short of smokes. Some
cleaver actor had accidintly lit the last mess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
fire with a bale of Virginias and there wasnt
hardly a smoke among us.</p>

<p>You just figure out how it would feel if
you was to have a bath and do your exercise and
eat a swell breakfast and then realise there
wasnt a pill in the house! Think sweetie, how
your brest would swell up with alarm, and the
royal fit you would throw while the elevator
boy was on his way to the corner drug store!
Why figure even the way you feel once you get
a cigarette in your face and then cant find a
match for two whole minutes. Well, take it
or leave it, I tell you that feeling is a whole lot
multiplied on the victorious fields of France
when little friend cigarette is notable by its
absence. A empty house on an opening night
is nothing to it. So you can see where me and
Ceasare and Mac was glad to get in the neighborhood
of one, leaving even all considerations
of the wine aside.</p>

<p>Well, we started out carrying each two jugs
and as we went the fellow which acts as usher,
or sentry on the road hollers at us do we know
the way and Ceasare and him jabbered at each
other in French in the remarkable fluent way
they do over here. And Ceasare laughed and
when we asked what it was he said the guy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
told him to look out Fritz didnt get us on the
open road, which was certainly some joke for
of course we hadn't been able to get near
enough to Fritz to hear him in some time.
So we laughed, too, for if any snipers had managed
to stay behind and opened up on us we
could of spotted them and wiped them out if
they had kept it up.</p>

<p>Well sweetie, there wasnt any road exactly
toward the place we was bound for on account
of our having done considerable trespassing on
private property and taking little notice of
fences whether barbed-wire or civilian or shell-holes
or trenches but having went straight
ahead. And after the last 5 years on upper
Broadway you will realize it comes easy enough
to me, I often having come unharmed from the
Claridge to the Astor, and the French fields
has nothing on that crossing. So to me that
first part of the trip was as little or nothing
and I was the cheerfulist of the party though
we was all pretty cheerful and singing a little
song of Ceasare's which I dont know what it
means but I guess I'd better not write it in
for fear you would.</p>

<p>Well, it was late afternoon and awful cold
for the time of year, and I was thinking that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
at home the frost was on the pumpkin and the
pumpkin would soon be in the pie and the
turkey was about to get the axe and Halloween
was due and a lot of nice things like that. And
after a lot of kilomets had been covered, we
come to the funny little town which looked like
the back-drop to the opening seane in a musical
comedy only all shot to pieces like it had
been on the road with a No. 2 company for a
long and successful tower.</p>

<p>Well, we come to it, anyhow, and being on
duty in a way as far as them jugs went&mdash;we
went with them and took what we could afford
our ownselves while we watched papa Ceasare
fill 'em up. Then the tobacco dept. claimed
our attention only to find there wasn't any!</p>

<p>Well, sweetie, I have tried to put over the
way I felt at these glad tidings and the censor
wouldn't of stood for it, so out she goes! But
I felt that way all right and so did Mac and
Ceasare.</p>

<p>"I'll no beleeve ut!" says Mack which he
talks a funny kind of way like Harry Lauder.
"I'll no beleeve ut&mdash;theer must be some someplace
aboot!"</p>

<p>"Say la guyer!" says Ceasare and gives a
shrug, although he was a lot more disappointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
than Mac on account of Mac's really caring
more for liquor than smoke any day. "Say
la Guyer!" he says, and asks his pa why it happened
and his pa tells him and he translates it
to Mac and me.</p>

<p>"He say a young lady have took it all only
hour ago for free to soldiers," he explains.</p>

<p>And take it or leave it, but I was certainly
a little sore for although I am the first to believe
in the other fellow getting it, still this time
we all felt like the other fellow was us, and no
doubt she had took it to the nearest camp or
hut, and so I ast which way was it she went
for mebbe we would get some of it. And then
come a big surprise.</p>

<p>"No 'ospitil here!" Ceasare explained again.
"An no 'ut! It ees too soon after we take it.
Then papa says she is first cross red lady we
have seen and she speak in French!"</p>

<p>"Well, that's funny!" I says&mdash;and of course
dearie you understand this had been enemy
ground only a little before and that there was
a wine-shop going was a miricle and only for
it being Ceasare's papa we wouldn't of got
none, which is how he come to be along with us.</p>

<p>Well, we all felt real sore and disappointed
but took it like a man for of course a red cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
nurse would get it for the wounded and we had
our health.</p>

<p>So papa give us all another round and we
took the big molasses jugs and started off. It
was getting toward twilight and pretty cold
and I will say it give me sort of sore feeling
towards the folks at home and blamed them
for letting me be without a cigarette and you
know how it is about two drinks makes me
a little sore at things and I began to cheer up
after the third and this was early in the evening.</p>

<p>Not so Mac. He has a talent for drink.
Well, we had just about left the motion-picture
village behind us when he commenced
to sing and while I dont know what it was
about, I will put it down this time because you
wont know neither.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Fortune if thou'll but gie me still</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Hale Breeks, a scone, an' whisky gill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">An' rowth o' ryme to rave at will,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Tak' a' the rest,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"An' deal 't about as they blind skill</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Directss thee best."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Well, naturally we applauded which is
always safe when you don't understand a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
thing, and it certainly was comical for Mac is
generally a quiet cuss and a tightwad as well.
Then I spoke up.</p>

<p>"These jugs is too heavy!" I says. "Let's
lighten 'em up a bit."</p>

<p>Well they thought so and we done it and
felt better and then I sang them:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">"Give me your love</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The sunshine of your eyes!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>And both Ceasare and Mac commenced to
cry. Mac set down his jugs and we done the
same and then Mac done the most generous
thing I ever seen a Scotchman do even in
liquor. He reached inside his bonnett and
took out three cigarettes, shook the bonnett to
show they was actually the last, and give us
each one and one to himself.</p>

<p>Well, we all sat down on a old motor chassis
or what was left of it, and burned them smokes
like insense, not speaking a word! But putting
that red cross lady which had been ahead
of us out of our minds and thinking only of
how we was going to give Mac our next
packages from home when they come, and he
mebbe thinking of how he was going to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
them. And then we all made our jugs a
little lighter and by this time it was pretty
dark and we commenced to hurry back. Before
we had went very far we had to hesitate
about which way. Because sweetie, take it or
leave it, what you write about getting lost in
the new subway has nothing on finding your
way about after dark by yourself in this part
of the world.</p>

<p>Well, Mac was sure we come one way and
I was sure we come another and Ceasare he had
a different hunch from either of us. So we all
took another little drink as it was getting
mighty cold by now, and in the end we started
off Ceasare's way because why wouldnt he
know best which way was right and him born
and raised right there on the farm? We
trusted to his judgment just like him and Mac
would of trusted me to tell the taxi-driver
where to go from Keens.</p>

<p>So we went like he said, but somehow we
didn't seem to get no place in particular although
we kept on going for a long time: I
couldn't say how long, but it seemed like a
Battery to Harlem job to me only by now I
loved everybody but Fritz and a sort of fog
had come up or so I thought, and we was all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
singing, each our own sweet songs but at the
same time.</p>

<p>"Lets throw away a few of these jugs," I
remember saying&mdash;and really there was so little
in some of them it wasn't worth carrying
back so we just finished them off and threw
them away and then we come upon a little path&mdash;or it felt like it.</p>

<p>"Allou!" shouted Ceasare, "we are almost
there!" and with that we sure got the surprise
of our lifes, for rat-tat-tat-tat-tat come a sputter
of machine gun fire right at us.</p>


<h3>                     III</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> first we was very much jolted by this
though unhurt, and then we commenced to
think it was a joke. Here we was going in
behind our own lines and being fired upon.</p>

<p>"Shut up, ye dam fools!" Mac hollered.
"Can ye no recognize yer own people?"</p>

<p>Then Ceasare yelled in French, but they
paid no attention to us. <i>Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat!</i>
it come again, and this time it made me real
mad. I figured that if they didn't quit their
nonsense somebody was liable to get hurt. So
I saved what was left in my last jug, threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the thing away, and told Ceasare and Mac to
come on and leave us beat up the poor boobs
with the nasty sense of humor and show them
where they got off. Well, Mac and him
thought this was a good idea so they done like
I done and we ran up the little hill which we
could see our way pretty good in spite of the
dark because they never let up on us but kept
right on spitting fire. Well, we got very mad
by this time and to tell the truth I can't very
well recall just what did happen only when
we got to the gun the boys was German!</p>

<p>Well, take it or leave it, I aint had a jolt
like that since the night Goldringer raised
our salary of his own accord after we put on
the La Tour Trot. And I only wisht I could
remember more about what happened. But
for quite a few minutes I was terrible busy;
and I guess I better admit I was tight&mdash;awful
tight. Of course there was five of them and
only three of us, and equally of course we
licked them badly and took only one prisoner
but not being anything for a lady to read I
will not give particulars and anyways I dont
remember any. Of course it was one of them
few remaining nest of hornets which we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
joked about, but really hadn't believed was
there.</p>

<p>Well, when it was all over but the cheering
and we was sure these birds had been all by
their lonesome, we was pretty well sobered
and hot and everything. And the first thing
we done was take a look around in a few
places for tobacco. And take it or leave it&mdash;we
didn't find any! Not a smoke among the
lot! Watter you know about that?</p>

<p>But one good thing we got out of the scrap
was our senses back and it was easy enough to
spot about where our own lines would be. So
after we figured it out, and taking Fritz, the
one prisoner, along, we commenced to start off
that way and you can bet the poor boob was
glad to go with us. You would of thought he
had wanted to be with us all the time. Just like
after a election at home. Cant find anybody
who didnt vote the winning ticket. Which
joke you may not understand, sweetie, being a
lady, and I will not now stop to explain.</p>

<p>Well, we started back alright and as we
come, I got the story which I want to tell
you which commenced really when we come to
that old barn. Only I had to explain how we
come to be there or you wouldnt get the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
of what I am driving at for you to make your
Ma understand.</p>

<p>Ever since I fell out of my airplane and was
in the hospital and reenlisted the only place
they'd take me back was in the infantry, I done
a lot of thinking&mdash;and some of it stuff which
might mebbe sound awful queer coming from
me, especially after some of the language I
have been known to use in my day, and while
I hope I aint become mushy, I certainly do
believe there is more to religion and such
things than we have thought. Take it or
leave it, mighty few fellows have lived through
this war, far less fought through it, without
getting religion of some kind out of it. I wonder
can you get me? And make Ma get it too.
So I'll tell what happened and you see if miricles
is over yet or not for this is a true fact and
not a story somebody told me.</p>

<p>Well, after we cleaned up that machine gun
nest and had a cute little live German prisoner
of our very own, we took him down the hill with
us the best way we could in the dark and it full
of holes and what not. There wasn't a bit of
light&mdash;no moon nor stars nor nothing, and a
wet sort of smell that made us wish for a smoke
the way hardly nothing else is ever wished for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
except mebbe a motion-picture salary or a
drink of water after a big night&mdash;not on the
desert.</p>

<p>Well we got on pretty good because we was
nearly sober now and Ceasare he knew where
we was going, and this time he really did, and
so we kept up pretty good. It commenced to
rain a little and the big drops felt awful nice
against my cheeks which was burning hot.
Made me think of when I was a kid back in
Topeka and digging out to school and a pair
of red mittens I had which my mother had
made them&mdash;good knitting and well made like
the sweater I had on that very minute which
she also knit. And I thought of me and you
and our snow-scene when we done that dance
on the Small Time with the sleighbells on our
heels&mdash;remember dear? Before we had really
made good except with each other? And I
thought about love too and a lot of fool stuff
like that. And then I heard a funny sound
for thereabouts. It was a woman moaning
and crying.</p>

<p>Well, at first I thought mebbe I was crazy
or imagined it, but Mac who was walking in
front with our own little Fritz stopped short
and so did Fritz and listened. It come again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>&mdash;the
most dismal thing you ever want to hear.
I turned to Ceasare and he had heard it.</p>

<p>"Say drool," he says, which means "Its
funny" only it wasnt and he didnt mean it that
way, but the other way. You know.</p>

<p>"It sure is!" I says. "There she goes again!"</p>

<p>"I think theers a wee bit housie over theere!"
says Mac.</p>

<p>"It is the barn of my cousin's uncle," says
Ceasare. "We better go look."</p>

<p>So with that we started across the road to
where sure enough was a funny little barn&mdash;stone
with a grass roof&mdash;peculiar to these
parts, I guess. The nearer we got the louder
the noise was, but no words to it, only sobbing
very low and despairing and sort of sick&mdash;and
a female&mdash;no doubt of it. There wasn't any
light nor anybody moving about as far as we
could tell.</p>

<p>"Gee! What'll we do?" I says in a whisper.
"We can't pass it up!"</p>

<p>"Naw&mdash;we mun tak' a look inside!" whispers
Mac.</p>

<p>"Certinmount," says Ceasare; "Mais&mdash;be
careful! We put the Boch in first and see if
some trick is up!"</p>

<p>It being Ceasare's cousin's uncle's barn he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
knew where the door was, and the three of us
shoved Fritz up to it and made him understand
he was to open it and go in ahead of the
crew. We finally got it over with signs and
shoves, because the bird didnt speak nothing
but German and we hadnt a word of it among
us. But still we made him do it and he did,
and we pulled our guns and stood close behind
and I stood closest and pulled not alone my
gun but the little electric flashlight you sent me
which I flashed in as quick as the door was
opened.</p>


<h3>                     IV</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> take it or leave it&mdash;there was a woman
with a baby in her arms! She was rather a
young round-faced woman and that kid was
awfully little and held close under a big dark
cloak the woman wore. The poor soul looked
tired out and she had no hat and her hair was
all down. The inside of the barn was a wreck
and the rain was coming in through a big shellhole
in the roof. She was all alone, we at once
got that, and at sight of the German uniform
which was all she seen at first, she give a shriek
of joy and got up onto her feet.</p>

<p>"Got si danke!" she cried. "Ich habe&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she seen the rest of us and shrunk back,
covering the kid with her cloak. Fritz said
something to her&mdash;quite a lot in a hurry, and
evidently told her he was a prisoner, and now
that she had spilled the beans, so was she. And
of course even under the circumstances, she
was. But take it or leave it, I certainly did
feel queer when I went up to that lady with the
little baby in that barn. For German or no
German the situation was&mdash;well&mdash;it certainly
got my goat. I took off my hat and made a
bow.</p>

<p>"Lady," I commenced, "have no fear. Don't
let us throw no scare into you. We ain't Huns&mdash;that
is, I beg your pardon, but what I mean
is you are perfectly safe and we will take care
of you."</p>

<p>Well, the way she looked at me would of
wrung a heart of stone. Her eyes was blue
and she just stared at me as if I had hurt her&mdash;which of course was far from any mind
there.</p>

<p>"Don't be scared," I says again. "You and
the baby will get good care. Just come with
us if you are able!"</p>

<p>When I spoke of the kid she give the poor
little smothered thing a quick look and drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
her cloak around it closer. Gee! but she looked
fierce! She had quit crying but not a word
out of her!</p>

<p>"You try!" I says to Ceasare. "The poor
thing mebbe understands French."</p>

<p>So Ceasare, who was as much shot to pieces
at the sight as I was, come forward.</p>

<p>"Madame!" says he, bowing with his cap in
his hand. Then he shoots a lot of French
about restes, au succuoor, and stuff I know
meant "cut the worry." But she didnt get it
any better than she had my line of talk, and
only kept on looking scared.</p>

<p>Well by this time Mac come out of his stupor;
but there was no use trying Scotch on
her, that was plain. So there was nothing to
it except forward march. For one thing my
torch wouldnt of lasted much longer and for
another it sure was getting late.</p>

<p>"Does your cousin's uncle which owns the
barn have a house anywheres near, where we
could leave her?" I asked Ceasare.</p>

<p>"All dead in this town!" he says cheerfully.
"And this is the only building left I think it!"</p>

<p>"Then there's nothing to do but take her
along to headquarters," I says, and off we
started, she not saying a word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>That was some trip! I want to tell you
sweetie it was the worst part of the whole war
to me. You know I got a heart and I felt
just fierce for that poor little German mother.
All the way in, while we was helping her along
I kept wishing I knew how on earth she come
to get in that place. She seemed real feeble
at times and we lifted her across the worst
places. I tried to get her to let me carry the
baby, but she held on to it like grim death and
wouldnt leave any of us touch it&mdash;and it was
so quiet I commenced to get scared.</p>

<p>"More than likely its dead!" I whispered to
Ceasare and he thought so too.</p>

<p>Before we got in, we had carried her almost
a mile, taking turns with her on our crossed
hands, and the odd feller guarding our Hun.
And then we came to the end of about the very
worst and longest hike I ever took including
the time the Queen of the Island Company
got stranded in New Rochelle. The sentry
across that mud hole of a slushy road was the
welcomest sight in the world.</p>

<p>"Wot the 'ell yer got?" he says when he
recognized us.</p>

<p>"One Gentleman Hun prisoner and one lady
ditto in very bad shape!" I says.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wot the 'ell!" he says again. And then
he passed us and we reported.</p>

<p>Say sweetie, take it or leave it, but I had
honest clean forgot all about that wine which
we had been sent for in the first place. I tell
you I was so worried about that poor woman!
And it was not until the five of us was standing
in Capt. Haskell's quarters with the light
from his ceiling glaring at us and him also
glaring from behind his mustache, that I even
commenced to remember it. But I had to report
so I reported for the bunch of us and in
strict detail as good as I could remember. All
this while the woman sat in a chair, her face
like a stone, and my heart just aching for her.</p>

<p>Well, when I got through taking the most
nervous curtin-call of my life&mdash;and take it or
leave it, if the German army would ever of
been as nervous as I was then, the war would
of ended that minute. Capt. Haskell beckoned
to the lady.</p>

<p>"Come here, please!" he says very kind.
"And let me see the baby!"</p>

<p>She got up and went over very softly. Then
she stood in front of him and commenced to
laugh and laugh.</p>

<p>"Pigs of Americans!" she said. "Fools to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
carry me! That's not a baby&mdash;its twenty cartons
of cigarettes!"</p>

<p>Then she threw back her cloak and under it
there she was dressed in Red Cross uniform.</p>

<p>"I disguised myself and went to the village!"
she went on in perfectly good English.
"And I bought all the tobacco there.</p>

<p>"On my way back to my own lines I was
fool enough to lose my way and to cry over
it! That is all!"</p>

<p>And its enough, aint it dear? For you do
get me, dont you? Them twenty cartons of
cigarettes was a miricle to us and the one we
needed the most of any right at that moment.
Eh, what? as the English say. And her taking
such a chance to get them for Fritz shows
how bad off the German army must be, don't
it? And so tell this to your Ma and get her
to quit that foolish anti-smoke society she's
forming&mdash;because its the bunk&mdash;and I am ever
your loving life and dancing partner,</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Jim</span>.</p>

<p>P. S. Just got your letter. That certainly
is a good one on Ma. Smoking a pipe! And
if you hadnt opened the door so sudden you'd
never in this world of caught her. And if she
does claim her grandmother did it too, all you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
got to say is so did many a soldier's grandmother.</p>

<p>P. S. No. 2. I forgot to say that a French
General has given us a kiss on both cheeks and
a medel for that job. And its the first time
I ever got anything but a headache by going
on a party.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<h3>               ANYTHING ONCE</h3>


<h3>                     I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Aint</span> it funny the things that comes into a
person's head when they are rubbing cold
cream onto their nose? All sorts of stuff,
some of it good sense and some of it the bunk.
But most of it pretty near O.K. If some one
was to take down the ideas I get at such a sacred
hour, I'd be out of the dancing game and
into the highbrow class just as quick as the
printer got through his job.</p>

<p>It sure is a time when a woman's true
thoughts come to the surface along with the
dust and last night's make-up, and many a big
resolve has been made owing to that cleanly
habit. Wasn't there some wise bird made up
a quotation about cleanliness being next to
God knows what? Well, believe you me, its
the truth, for once a woman starts in with the
cold cream all alone,&mdash;and she sure does it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
no other time&mdash;there is no telling what will
come of it beside a clean pink face.</p>

<p>With me personally myself, thats where
most of my ideas about life come from&mdash;right
out of the cold cream tube! And while indulging
in this well known womanly occupation
the other evening I commenced thinking
about rest and how important it is for us
Americans&mdash;and of the way we go after it&mdash;like
it was something we had to catch and catch
quick or it would get away from us. Do you
get me? If not, leave me tell you what a
friend of mine, which has just been mustard
out of the service says to me, when I was
checking up his experiences abroad while he
was checking up what the waiter had put down.</p>

<p>"My idea of rest?" he says. "Why taking
Belleau Woods after three restless weeks in
the trenches," he says.</p>

<p>Which sort of puts the nut in the shell, as
the saying is. And also at the same time reminds
me of the rest I just recently took.</p>

<p>Not that I generally need one any more
than any other thoroughly successful star, for
heavens knows the best known parlor dancing
act in the world and Broadway, which mine undoubtedly
is, dont need to rest because the managers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
theirselves always come after me and
resting I leave to the booking-agency hounds.
But this time it was bonea fido, and come about
in a sort of odd way.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>To commence at the start it begun with me
falling for the movies, which Gawd knows I
only done it for the money, their being no art
in it, and they having hounded me into them
for a special fillum. And of course many well
known girls like Mary Garden and Nazimova
go into pictures and even myself, but its simply
because of being hounded, as I say. But
once in you earn your money, believe you me,
and I have stood around waiting for the sun
like Moses, or whoever it was, until my feet
nearly froze to the pallasades before jumping
off, only of course it was a dummy they threw
after I had made the original motions of the
leap to death. And the worst part is once
you are signed up on one of these "payment
to be made wheather the party of the first part
(thats me) is working or not" you got to do
like they say, and a whole lot of the "not working"
means plain standing around waiting for
the director or the camera-man or the rain to
quit, and what us public favorites suffers when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
on the job is enough to make the photographor's
Favorite of Grainger, Wyo., abandon
the career she might of had in favour of domestic
service or something like that where
she'd get a little time to herself.</p>

<p>Well anyways my judgment having slipped
to the extent of having signed my sense of humor
away for six months at twenty-two hundred
a week, I was in the very middle of a
fillum called the Bridge to Berlin when one
day, just as a big brute of a German officer
by the name of O'Flarety had me by the throat
in a French chateau, the studio manager comes
in and says the armistice is signed and the war
is over, and we was to quit as who would release
a war fillum now and we was to start on
something entirely different, only he didn't
know what the hell it was to be and here was
eight thousand feet wasted&mdash;and believe you
me I was sore myself for we had shot that
strangling sceene six times by then and my
marcelle wave was completely ruined by it, and
I would of liked to of had something to show
for it.</p>

<p>But anyways, orders was to quit and so me
and Ma and the two fool dogs and Musette
left the wilds of Jersey and after a stormy voyage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
across the Hudson come safely home to
our modest little apartment on the drive, there
to not work at 22 hundred a week until Goldringer
got the studio manager to get the scenario
editor to get me a new story, which at
the price was not of long duration for while
Gawd knows they dont care how long a person
stands around waiting to be shot, they just
naturally hate to pay you for doing the same
thing at home in comfort.</p>

<p>Well anyways the bunk that scenario editor
picked out was something fierce. I wouldn't
of been screened dead in it. But it just happened
I had a idea for a scenario myself, which
come about through somebody having give me
a book for Christmas and one night, the boy
having forgot to bring the papers, I read it.
And was it a cute book? It was! I had a
real good cry over it, and while it wasn't exactly
a book for a dancer, I could see that there
was good stuff in it. So finally me and Ma
stopped into Goldringer's office after he had
twice telephoned for me and handed him a little
surprise along with the volume.</p>

<p>"I got a idea for a picture, Al," I says, "and
here's the book of it."</p>

<p>"Well Miss La Tour, what's the name of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and idea?" says he, chewing on his cigar strong
and not even looking at the book but throwing
it to the stenographer, which is a general rule
always in the picture game and one reason we
don't see such a crowd of swell fillums.</p>

<p>"The name is Oliver Twist," I says. "It's a
juvinile lead the way it stands, but I want it
fixed up a little, with me as Olivette Twist&mdash;the
editor can fix it so's that will be all right.
It's really a swell part. I could wear boy's
clothes some of the time."</p>

<p>"Huh! Olivette Twist," says Goldringer,
taking back the book and looking at the cover
of it. "Always thought it was a breakfast
food! But if you say its O.K. we'd better get
it. Where is this feller Dickens? We'll wire
him for the rights. Friend of yours?"</p>

<p>You see, if anybody brings scenarios personally,
a star in particular, it's generally a
friends.</p>

<p>"No," I says. "It was sent me by Jim
along with a letter which shows the bird is well
known," I says. "And is in Westminister
Abby, London, England, which Jim says
proves his class.</p>

<p>"Must be a swell apartment," says Goldringer.
"All right we'll send a cable to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and see if the picture rights is gone or not. If
the boy is so well known he may stick out for
a big price. This is Thursday. We may hear
from him by Monday or Tuesday, and we'll
get a scenario ready anyways so's we can begin
to shoot not later than a week from to-day.
Until then," he says, "run along and amuse
yourself and dont do anything I wouldnt."</p>

<p>Well, me and Ma was shown out then and
down on Broadway Ma see some salt-water
taffy in a drug-store and wanted to go in and
by it which I had to prevent because outside
of Ma being in no need of nourishment, she
weighing considerable over the heavy-weight
requirements already and Gawd knows if she
was to have went back into the circus it would
no longer be on the trapeese and a certain party
in the side-show would have a strong competitor
for her job and it wouldn't be the human
skeleton either. But leaving off the consideration
how would it look for us to go up the
Ave. in my new wine-colored limousine which
I earned myself and no one can say different
with truth&mdash;and eating stuff like that out of
a folded paper box? Ma certainly has my
health well in hand and heart and its seldom
we quarrel over any little thing, but she certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
has no class instinct, or instinct for class&mdash;do
you get me? And when I try to make
her see that them little refinements is what
makes me the big success I am, she sometimes
kicks and if its hunger, its got to be met immediately
if not one way, why then another.
So in lieu, as the poet says, of the taffy I had
to take her to the Ritz and watch her put away
6 vanillia eclairs at two bits each and a quart
of cocoa, not that I begrudge the money, only
believe you me the way all hotels charge nowadays
is rapidly making Bolshivik out of even
we capatalists. Do you get me? You do!
But of course in my line you got to keep before
the public in the right way.</p>

<p>Well anyways Ma complained over the loss
of that taffy the whole way through the six
eclairs, which it was certainly a little hard on
me to have to sit there and watch her while for
professional reasons eating only one of these
tomato surprises which never surprise but the
once, on my figures account, and certainly its
a fact that the two of us was doing the next
best thing to what we wanted instead of the
thing itself which is one of the prices of success.
So, as is also often the case at such
times, I was a little mean to Ma on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
of having been mean already&mdash;do you get me?</p>

<p>"Mamma," I says. "You certainly are getting
heavier. It's a crime for you to wear
these narrow skirts!"</p>

<p>Ma give me a searching look the same as used
to lead up to caster oil when I was a kid, and
then took the half of a eclair at one bit before
replying.</p>

<p>"Now Mary Gilligan you needn't take out
your artistic temperament or any other ailment
on me!" she says as firmly as the eclair would
permit. "Just because Jim is in France yet,
and your moleskin dolman was a failure and
you aint been occupied daily for a week or
more, and slipped up on doing your setting up
exercises this morning which I wouldnt of
mentioned only you started it," she says. "Its
no excuse for picking on me," she says. "What
if I am a little plump? My Gawd aint I
earned the right to be? What with three kids
and your Pa to bring up and the center trapeese
in the circus right through it all except
when absolutely necessary? You dont know
what a woman <i>can</i> go through!"</p>

<p>"Dont I, just!" I snapped for my Gawd aint
it the truth every woman has the very worst
troubles that any woman ever had? And she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
sure gets sore when another woman sets up to
go them one better!</p>

<p>"No you don't!" retorts Ma with that maddening
air of being older than me which she
uses to squelch me every time she cant get me
any other way. "No you dont!" she says.
"You never brought up three kids without a
nurse girl while on the trapeese&mdash;you never
brought up a thing but two fool dogs and you
even leave them to the carelessness of a personal
maid," she says. "Poor dears, Gawd
knows what will become of their little canine
minds and morals!"</p>

<p>"Now Ma!" I begged, because she aughter
know that is a sore point with me and not intention,
and she had me on the raw.</p>

<p>"Well then!" she says. "You got a swell
job and no troubles only mabe a sluggish liver
and you aint the only woman in America which
Gen. Pershing cant yet spare the husband of,"
she says. "And mabe I do need to reduce a
little," which was her way of apologizing.
And just as this lull occurred who should come
into sight but Maison Rosabelle, her which runs
the shop where myself and all the most chic
professionals gets their clothes. She was all
dressed up like a plush horse with real sables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
part of which must of come off them simple
refined little gowns I had made for the Bridge
to Berlin that was ruined by the armistice. Her
hair had just been rehennered and her face was
as fresh as a tea-rose straight from the fragrent
facial massage. She smiled and sailed down
on the two of us which we welcomed with the
usual relief of a family quarreling when neither
sees the way to win out and have got to go on
living together. In other words she automatically
buried the hatchet for us, as the
school books say.</p>

<p>"So pleased to of run into you, dearies!"
she says. "For I'm goin' to Atlantic City to-morrow
for a little rest."</p>

<p>No sooner was them words out from between
her lip-rouge than I see a vision of salt-water
taffy arising in Ma's eyes. Believe you me
Ma is certainly hard to pry loose from anything
she has once set her mind on! And
Maison had to continue in that cordial manner.</p>

<p>"Why dont you run down for a few days?"
she says. "It'll do you good. You're looking
kinda pulled down Mrs. Gilligan!" she
says&mdash;and of course Ma fell for that.</p>

<p>"I do feel a little low!" she says, finishing
off her cocoa. "And Mary&mdash;Marie here is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
waiting until they get a answer to a cable which
was sent to England by the studio. I understand
we may have quite a wait, so I really
believe we might go along."</p>


<h3>                    II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> as I looked at Ma it come over me that
mabe she had the right dope. When people
that live together, especially if not friends, but
relations, commence to get a little on each others
nerves, going away on a trip is good for
what ails them. The only trouble is that in
the case of females they generally go together.
Still, with the whole bunch of new and different
stuff it gives them to fight over&mdash;R.R.
tickets, and who wired for these horrid rooms,
and I told you to bring a heavier coat, and
etc., they generally get straightened out quite
a lot. Even the idea of going along with
Maison didnt worry me then, I having been
on tower many a time when the No. 1 Company
went out and Ma the same for years, and we
generally speak, even to the publicity man, no
matter if we have made Rochester, Buffalo and
Chicago in a quick jump playing matinées as
well. So I am without the wholesome and well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
founded fear of taking a pleasure-trip with
friends which is the bitter fruit of most persons
experience of the same. Besides, I sort
of like Maison, which of course her real name
is Maisie Brady, and her funny little husband,
which is also still in France, she not being dependant
any more than myself nor would she
hold him back from serving his country only
I dont hardly believe she urged him to go for
quite the patriotic reasons I did, he having been
a traveling man and so when he retired on her
income she didnt feel as natural and affectionate
and homelike and all that as when he was
away most of the time. But at any rate I and
she were both war-widows and old friends from
the time her mother was lady-lion tamer and
mine on the trapeese, and so in spite of the
bills she charges me she has more refinement
than most people and so I says all right, we'll
go to Atlantic City and we'll be on the one
twenty train to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Thats sweet, dearie!" says Maison.
"We'll get a swell rest!"</p>

<p>Then she set sail and was off with a Jewish
gentleman friend, which had been waiting at
the entrance all this time with a gardenia in
his buttonhole. And Ma and me called for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the check and dogs and limousine and hitched
our way homeward through the traffic to our
quiet little apartment with 7 windows with
the beautiful outlook of the river and the R.R.
tracks and etc.</p>

<p>Then while Musette packed only three
trunks and my gold-fitted dressing case and
a couple of hat boxes and my specially designed
jewellery box and the travelling hamper for
the dogs, we having decided to travel light and
probably not stay over three or four days, Ma
went into the all-tiled kitchen and commenced
getting up a little smack of cold beef and potato
salad and fried cheese sandwiches and
coffee and a few hot biscuits and honey so's we
wouldn't have to go out and eat, which Ma
certainly loves to do and no cook ever stands
it for more than a week and the current cook's
week was up that morning before we went
downtown.</p>

<p>Well anyway while she was doing this I went
into the drawing-room which is all fitted up
in handsome gold furniture&mdash;that the dealer
said was one of the Louis periods. Louis Cohen
I guess,&mdash;I never remember quite. And
to put a record on the phonograph in the case
I had especially built in the same style at fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
dollars extra and all the instalments paid, and
streached out as good as I could manage to on
the chaise loung, which is a sort of housebroken
steamer-chair, and while John Macormik's
own voice sang my little grey home in the
west to me in the privacy of my own home, I
thought dreamingly about Jim and how much I
was missing him and how swell we danced together
and how kind and loving and brave he
was and how refined, and believe me he's about
the only theatrical male that don't murder a
dress suit, and how horrible it was to be seperated
from him after being married only two
weeks and what fools we was to have danced together
in every first-class theatre in America
and only got married so recent, for if only
we'd been married sooner mabe the pain of seperation
wouldnt of been so great by now. Who
knows? And believe you me it was some pain,
and I had myself crying before I knew it. For
I sure am stuck on that poor simp and my only
war-work aint been done on the screene, Gawd
knows, when I give him up to whatever the
Allies was fighting for, which if it dont turn
out to be as represented, believe you me, myself
and a whole lot of other girls is going to
want to know why!!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Well anyways, before Ma had the biscuits
baked and I had run jada jada and sing me
to sleep, I was wild to get away to the pure
country ocean air and some healthy outdoor
exercise which would help me forget my loneliness.
And a lot of quiet and rest and sleep,
with the ocean pounding me to the pillow and
all that.</p>

<p>I had only a sort of twenty minute small
time sketch of a idea of what Atlantic City
was like on account of me having been there
for openings only and getting in at four forty
five with the show beginning at eight fifteen
and the washup you need after the trip and
Ma always insisting on me doing a twenty
minute practice in my room and underwear before
every opening which is perfectly correct
and one of the principal things which has made
my handsprings what they are, and getting
dinner far enough in advance to do the hand-springs
in time. I knew little nor nothing of
what Jim calls the Coney Island that went to
finishing school except that there is swimming
and horseback riding and a boardwalk that
any one without French heels to catch in the
cracks can have a elegant walk on. What little
sniff of air I had outside the theatre and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
bedroom at the hotel give me a appatite for
more, which up to now I never had the opportunity
to get because of always being with a
high-class show that went right back to N.Y.
Sunday to open on Broadway. But now I was
going like a regular American lady citizen to
rest and get full of health and do as the regular
resorters did. And I was glad. I was so
anxious to keep myself in a pure atmosphere
for Jim's sake and the studio wasn't exactly the
farm&mdash;do you get me? You do! And a rest
in the country was the very thing. I got quite
excited thinking about it; dried my tears,
stopped the phonograph and made sure that
Musette put in my riding suit, bathing ditto,
and walking boots. And when this was done
I felt better already as the saying is, and fully
able to take some of the nourishment Ma had
got up.</p>

<p>The minute we set down to the table I see
that she had also been making good resolutions
and waited till she got ready to confess.
It come after the seventh tea-biscuit and honey.
On her part I mean, I only taking coldmeat
and salad and things I dont like much, for
reasons before stated.</p>

<p>"Mary Gilligan!" she says. "I believe I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
getting heavier," she says, just as if it occurred
to her for the first time. "And I have decided
that while I am away to Atlantic City I wont
eat to amount to anything and reduce in other
ways the whole time I'm there!"</p>

<p>"You dont say," I says, without batting an
eye. "Do you really think you need to?"</p>

<p>"I do!" she says. "This is my last real meal.
And you needn't try to persuade me out of it."</p>

<p>I didn't. And next morning right after
breakfast we caught the one twenty, hats, dogs,
Musette, and all, and met up with Maison
Rosabelle, which was dressed in a simple little
trotters costume of chiffon and ermine which
looked like it had been made in Babylon. I
mean B.C. not L.I. And with her was a little
surprise in the way of the same Jewish gentleman,
Mr. Freddy Mayer, with another gardenia
on him and a fine line of plausable explinations.</p>

<p>"Aint it a co-co-strange, Freddy just happens
to be going our way!" cooed Maisie with
all the innocence of a N.Y. livery-stable pidgeon.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm taking a special offering of champagne
to a special friend in the hotel business
there," says Mr. Freddy. "And with three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
such beautiful lady companions its no hardship
to leave Manhattan behind nor the
Bronx," says he gaily. "Altho when we come
back we may find the Aldermen has decided
to change both names after July first," says
the humorous dog.</p>

<p>"Will you please kindly open this window a
little?" I intrupped him. "The air in here
aint so good as it was."</p>

<p>I dont know did this get over, but believe
you me I didn't care for that well washed
young wine-seller at all, nor for his company.
And it was a relief when he done as I asked
and him and Maison found their seats was at
the other end of the car. In a way I can understand
her liking traveling-men but not up
to the point of traveling with one, even by semi-accident.
And so opening the Motion Picture
Gazette to look at the double-page spread of
myself "Who has at length been lured by the
artistic possibilities of the picture world," and
keeping a eye on Ma to see would she stop the
candy-boy, settled down to the soothing sound
of Maison's laugh, and begun my quiet little
trip to Healthland.</p>

<p>There is a large variaty of ladies which have
husbands still in the army, but believe you me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
they certainly got one thing in common, or
else no looks at all. And that is, the temptation
to take up with other company to some
degree. Because of course while the war was
holding the stage a husband's absence could be
stood, but what with this peace-hyphen in the
fighting and everything, you cant help but
commence wondering what kind of a girl is
detaining him over there and feel inclined to
have a understudy kind of waiting off stage in
self defence. For believe you me, there seems
to be something sort of attractive about a war-widow
and the ones which ignores the fact and
minds their own affairs is the real patriotic
women of America.</p>

<p>Not that I want to say a word about Maison,
and what happened to me after the end of that
train ride on which I was sitting so superior-minded,
taught me a lesson; because its a cinch
to be good when you want to be. A person
which has suffered themselves is slow to bawl
out the other fellow so quick next time. Do
you get me? Not yet.</p>

<p>Well, after we had rolled by the lovely
scenery and read the handsome ad. signs on
either hand, not to mention the pipe-line, and
got the invigorating smell of low tide in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
eager nostrils, we come out on that quiet little
country railroad station platform, our destination,
to be greeted by only several hundred
busses and a thousand or so taxi-cabs,
each yelling at the top of their voices. As we
got off the train Maison rushes up to us and
pipes a cheering little question.</p>

<p>"Where are we going, dearie?" she said,
blithly.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" I says. "Maison
Rosabelle, do you mean to say you didn't wire
no place for rooms?"</p>

<p>"Why no!" says Maison. "Didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" I says. "I never wired
for rooms in my whole life. The advance
agent always done that for me."</p>

<p>"Well Mary Gilligan, I'm not your advance
agent!" she snapped, and then she kind of
looked at Mr. Freddy in a sweet, helpless
womanly fashion expecting him to fork up a
little help. But it seems Mr. Freddy was one
of these birds that only think to take care of
his own comfort. He had a room alright
at the Traymore. And he meant to
keep it!</p>

<p>"We'll take the bus to there," he suggested.
"I'm sure there'll be lots of room."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>But no bus for me on account of professional
reasons. So we took one taxi for him and
us and another for Musette and the dogs and
the bags, and then commenced a round of seeking
for shelter as the poet says, which had the
"Two Orphans" skun a mile. We went to six
hotels and not a room among them. Believe
you me, there is just one person can make you
feel cheaper than a Atlantic City hotel clerk
when he says "No reservations?" and lifts his
arched brows, and that is the head waiter when
he says "nothing to drink?" and you say "yes,
nothing!" Well, thank Gawd thats one thing
prohibition will prohibit.</p>

<p>Well anyways, we tried six hotels until at
last we come to a little place where the young
feller at the desk give his reluctant consent to
our admission. It was a simple little place
done quitely in red plush and gold and marble
columns, very restful with not over a hundred
people sitting about in the lobby, listning not
to the sad sea waves but to a jazz orchestra
and inhaling the nice fresh tobacco smoke of
which the air was full.</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Freddy give a gasp of relief and
bid us good-by, after dating up Maisie for dinner,
and a flock of bell-hops hopped upon our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
stuff and we commenced a walking tower to
our rooms. As we started off down the Alleyway,
Maison give me a nudge.</p>

<p>"Look it, that sweet young officer! Aint
he handsome?" she whispers only just loud
enough for him to hear. And before I thought
I turned my head and he certainly was easy
to look at. He looked, in fact like a cross between
a clothing ad. and a leading juvinille
with a touch of bear-cat in him to make a regular
he-man out of him. He was a captain, although
so young, and had a cute little moustache
and had that blue-blooded air&mdash;you know&mdash;like a Boston accent even without hearing
him speak. And he was sitting all alone under
a big poster advertising a entertainment
for the benefit of blind soldiers or something.
Of course I didn't notice him at all, because
I being a perfect lady I dont do them things.
But I couldnt help seeing that he didn't blush
at what Maisie said, although I knew he heard
it, but a sort of crinkly expression come up
round his nice blue eyes as if he thought us
comic or something. It made me just boil because
my clothes is nothing if not refined and
I never wear anything but a little powder on
my nose when off the stage, and if its one thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
gets my goat it is to be taken for a show-girl
which undoubtedly he thought the two of us
was and they not in his class, for even with the
passing glance I had taken I could see he was
used to the Vanderbilts and all that set and had
never had to be taught to take his daily tub.
Do you get me?</p>

<p>So I walked like I hadnt looked, and of
course I really hadnt, and proceeded to the before
the war section of the hotel and the handsome
suite all fitted in real varnished pine and
carpets just like a Rochester boarding house
when I was on the small time before I made
my big success, and it made me feel quite at
home or would of only for what I knew the
difference in price was going to be. I guessed
it just as soon as I heard Ma gasping over the
hotel rules which she was reading. I went over
and looked at them too, and at first I couldn't
see nothing unusual about them. There was
the usual bunk about the management not being
responsible for the guest in any way, and
Gawd knows how could they be and I dont
blame them. And then, a little ways down I
see what had got Ma stirred up. It seems dogs
was ten dollars a week per each, and of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
we had two of them and Ma never has cared
for my two, anyways.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope the sea air will be good for
the poor little lambs," she says very sarcastic.
"Mebbe it'll make 'em grow&mdash;into police-dogs
or something useful!"</p>

<p>Well I see by this that the salt air had not
yet got to Ma, although the troublesome journey
had. And so I put on a simple little suit of
English tweed and low heeled shoes and a
walking hat, which seemed to me the right
thing for the country, and went out to pry off
a little health before dinner.</p>

<p>The outdoors was something grand. The
air was as good a cocktail as a person would
want, and the lights along the boardwalk was
coming out like dandelion blossoms. There
was hardly anybody around&mdash;just a few here
and there and the surf of that wide and cruel
ocean which Jim was the other side of, was
breaking close to the rail in big white ostrich
plumes. Overhead the sky was as clear and
high as a circular drop with the violet lights on
it, and a few clean stars was coming out. It
was just cold enough to make a person want
to walk fast until the blood got singing through
you and you wanted to shout and run, only of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
course no lady would. But just the same, I
commenced to feel glad I hadnt died when I
had the measles, and I loved everybody and
had a great career before me and&mdash;and&mdash;oh
that grand yearning happy feeling which
comes out of being young and full of strength
and a good bank-account. Do you get me?
You do!</p>

<p>Well anyways, here I was walking like I
had money on it and huming a tune to myself,
when along comes a man the other way, walking
two to my one, and huming the same tune,
"How I hate to get up in the morning," it
was. When he heard me and I heard him we
both sort of half stopped out of surprise, and
I got a good look at him. It was the young
Captain from the hotel.</p>

<p>He also give a start of surprise when he seen
me, showing he recognized me just as good as
I did him. Only it was a real, genuine start,
as if he realized something more than the fact
he had seen me at the hotel. Then he smiled&mdash;a
smile which would of done any dental ad.
proud, and passed along, looking back over his
shoulder&mdash;once. While I went along minding
my own business and only know he looked back
on account of my happening to look back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
see how far I had gone. I went a mile further
and somehow that smile of his stuck in my mind
and made me sort of happy for no reason, and
at the same time awful extra lonesome for
Jim. I made up my mind I would get Jim a
new car for a surprise when he come home and
I would send him a extra box of eats this week
and some of them cigarettes he likes so well,
and a whole lot of stuff like that, the way a
woman does at such a time. Do you get me?
Probably.</p>

<p>Well anyways, I walked myself into a terrible
enthusiasm over Jim, and then come back
to the hotel. Which, by the way, its a strange
thing how much further it is coming back to a
Atlantic City hotel than walking away from
it. And there at the door was Ma with the
two dogs. A real strange sight for I never
knew her to take them out before, and it looked
like a guilty conscience, for she give me a peek
out of the corner of her eye for some reason
and then hastily explained how she had thought
she'd take them herself this time instead of
Musette. Well, we got rid of the dogs and
then come down to dinner where Maison sailed
down upon us all dressed up and no place to
go, for it seems this Mr. Freddy had stood her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
up on the dinner, having telephoned he'd be
over later with a friend or two but business prevented
him paying for her meal, or at least
thats what I expect he meant. And Maison
was wild. But she had to eat dinner with us,
and register a bunch of complaints between
bowing to friends and so forth.</p>

<p>"The luck I have!" she says. "That guy
Freddy doesn't think any more of a nickle than
he does of his right arm! And with all the
conventions which is held at this town of course
we would have to pick on the date the Baptist
ministers was here! Its a fact! The clerk
told me. And what is more if there ain't Ruby
Roselle and Goldringer and will you look at
that wine and it twelve a quart without the
tax! Well, of all things!"</p>


<h3>                    III</h3>

<p>And there sure enough was Ruby across the
room with Goldringer, which he evidently had
come down to wait for the answer to that cable
in the fresh air, and I suppose Ruby was a accident,
the same as Freddy, for goodness
knows, I wouldnt say a thing against her even
behind her back&mdash;and a good deal could be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
behind what shows of it when in costume. But
I wouldnt say it anyhow, because even if it was
the truth that woman would sue a person for
liabale if only to get her name in the paper.
And if she happened to be taking dinner with
Goldringer, Gawd knows, its a comparatively
free country and he's her manager as well as
mine and its a good thing to assume its only
business whenever possible as thinking the best
of people never hurt anybody yet.</p>

<p>Also across the room all by himself was that
young Captain, and he looked over twice but
of course I pretended it was the picture on the
wall over his head which had took my eye. Altogether
that strange dining room wasnt much
more lonesome to us than the Ritz or Astor for
tea would of been. But the most remarkable
part of the meal was Ma. Because she didn't
touch it! Actually, and it the American plan
which would tempt one of these Asthetics if
for no other reason but that you have to pay
for it anyway. And all she took was a piece
of meat about the size of a dime and a leaf
of salad.</p>

<p>"I'm going to stick by what I said if only
because you said I wouldnt!" she says, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
me square in the eye. "Diet is my middle
name."</p>

<p>Well, I mentally give her until to-morrow
on that but said nothing at the time. And we
went out into the lounge where Mr. Freddy
and three friends was already lounging and
after they had joined us, Goldringer and Ruby
did the same, and the drinks commenced to
flow with that frantic haste like into a river
at the edge of the ocean as the poet says, meaning
because its near its finish. While I, never
using any alcohol myself except to remove my
make up, sat there flushed with Bevo, and
couldn't help noticing the way the Captain
which he was still all alone, looked over at the
menagerie, and it made me boil for how could
I help that piker Freddy and his cheap friends
and the rest, and believe you me there are many
perfect ladies in pictures and on the stage, only
the public dont often recognize them because
they are swamped with a bunch of roughnecks
which all are popularly supposed to be.</p>

<p>It was a big relief when the Captain got up
and went away about nine, and left us to a
endurance contest as to which could sit up the
longest in that refreshing atmosphere of
cigarette smoke and drinks and ten-dollar perfume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
with the sad sea waves beating vainly
outside the carefully glass enclosed verandah
until one o'clock&mdash;when I personally went to
bed leaving them to their fate.</p>

<p>I give the telephone operator a terrible
shock by leaving a call for seven thirty, and
when it come I put on my riding suit which
I had left from a dance called "The Call to
Hounds" which Jim and me done at the Palace
just before he enlisted, and went out into the
keen morning air. And it was some air!
Then I commenced to look around for horses
but had great difficulty in finding the same, for
it seems the Atlantic City horses dont get up
any earlier than most of the visitors, and believe
you me I and a few coons which were
picking up scraps and so forth off the boardwalk,
was the only birds in sight at that hour.
Well anyways I walked along breathing in that
sweet air at about fifty cents per breath by the
hotel rates, but feeling pretty good in spite of
it, when I actually found a place where the
horses was up&mdash;or mabe they had been all
night. I got a horse which looked considerable
like a moth-eaten property one but could
go pretty good and commenced to ride gently
along what seemed to be my private ocean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
when all of a sudden who would I see but the
young Captain riding very good indeed. He
come up to me on high and then tried to put
on the brakes when he seen who it was, but the
horse had its mind on something else and
wouldnt, so he got by me but not without a
"Good morning!" Which I thought fairly safe
to smile at seeing we was so rapidly going in
opposite directions. But it seems he must of
spoke roughly to his steed for he come up behind
me and spoke with just that grand refined
Big-Time drawing-room act accent I knew by
his little moustache he would have.</p>

<p>"I say! What luck!" he says. "You are
Miss Marie LaTour, are you not?"</p>

<p>Was I sore? I was. Any lady would be
and of course after the company he seen me in
at the hotel what could I expect but to be
picked up? But more particularly as he had
my name and it with a good reputation, and
no one can say different with truth, I simply
had to show him where he got off.</p>

<p>"Sir!" I says, just like a play. "Sir! I do
not know you. Please beat it at once!"</p>

<p>"I know, but really!" he begged, flashing
that white smile. "I'm not trying to be impertenant&mdash;let
me explain...."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Explain nothing!" I says very haughty.
"I wont listen."</p>

<p>"But I'm not doing what you think!" he
cries out. "Please wait until you hear...."</p>

<p>"I've heard that 'please listen' stuff before,"
I says. "Good-by!"</p>

<p>And then I done the bravest act of my life,
not being really acquainted with horses, especially
Atlantic City ones. I give the horse a
lash and off we went, I trying hard to give the
impression of a good rider and not looking
back because I dasn't with that animal headed
for the steel pier full clip. But I heard the
Captain's remarks, just the same.</p>

<p>"By jove, I'll <i>make</i> you listen to me&mdash;just
for that!" he says. And I heard no more, for
the bird which keeps the horses come out and
rescued me just before we hit the pier and I
got off and started for the hotel, boiling with
rage. Me treated like a common chorus girl!
Me, once the best known parlor dancing act
in the world, and now even more so on the motion
picture screen and a lady or dead! I
wouldnt of looked at that guy again on a bet&mdash;I
made up my mind right then and there to
show him his mistake and that if my accent
wasnt as good as his my morals was better and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
no attempt on his part could get me to speak
to him again.</p>

<p>Well in this state of mind I run into Ma,
just before we reached the hotel which she was
hurrying to just ahead of me, and believe you
me I was sure surprised because I never knew
her out so early although she generally is up by
seven, but with her curlpapers still on and a
kimona and thats different from coming out
in public.</p>

<p>"I've been taking my exercise!" she says
before I could speak. "And I'm glad to see
you do the same," she says.</p>

<p>And I certainly had to hand it to her
strength of mind because after being out so
early and all she eat was only tea and dry
toast for breakfast.</p>

<p>After which we stopped by the office and
just before we got there I see the Captain give
a note to the clerk and walk away. When we
asked for mail that note was the first thing the
clerk handed me.</p>

<p>"Captain Raymond just left this for you
Miss LaTour," he says.</p>

<p>I didnt even open it.</p>

<p>"Kindly return it," I says, very dignified,
giving it back, and looked over my other mail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
But no letter from my husband, which is always
the way on a day a woman most needs
one. So I went upstairs very low in my mind
and sort of glad that even if Jim couldn't think
to write there was others would be glad enough
to if they was let. And then I went and got
Maison out of bed which she was taking her
breakfast in.</p>

<p>"You come down here for your health and
look what you do to it!" I says, and made her
go for a boardwalk which she held out for about
half a hour and no wonder with the heels she
wears, and then stopped me with a gasp.</p>

<p>"Dearie, you surely must be the one that
put the hell in health," she says, "For heavens
sakes leave us sit down."</p>

<p>Well we did, and in about five minutes along
comes Mr. Freddy with a friend, Mr. Sternberg,
and it was remarkable how quick Maison
recovered her strength, with the result that we
spent a quiet little morning and about fifty dollars
of Mr. Sternberg's money on shooting-galleries
and throwing rings and carousels and
a Japanese auction and other restful seaside
sports, and ended at a quiet little café simply
done in paper roses and rubber palm trees
where the drinks was only seventy-five cents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
per each and I had to sit and watch them again,
Ma having gone off to exercise and not appearing
to want me along with her.</p>

<p>Well anyways I was sort of relieved over
not having to eat lunch with Captain Raymond
looking on back at the hotel, and was just
thinking of it when who would come into that
café but the Captain himself, alone except for
another officer, a Lieutenant with his arm in
a sling and caught sight of me the very minute
he sat down.</p>

<p>Well of course I didnt look over at him but
I couldnt help noticing he called a waiter and
wrote a note on a piece of paper and that the
waiter brought it over to me.</p>

<p>And Maison seen it too, and her gentleman
friends the same, and did they kid me? They
did! But I kept the bird which had brought
the note over while I tore it in two without
reading it and sent it back again that way and
believe you me that got over, because I could
see Captain Raymond turn red all the way
across the noisy room.</p>

<p>Well I thought that had settled it and spent
a mournful if busy afternoon in another café
where there was lots of smoke and a Jazz band
and dancing and Maison was real happy because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
she had finally got Mr. Freddy to spend
a nickle and a half. But I was lower than
ever in my mind thinking how much more often
some soldiers seemed able to write than others.</p>

<p>Well, after we had taken a nice walk in the
fresh air nearly three blocks long, I got back
to the hotel to find that Goldringer was giving
a party that night beginning with dinner and
of course Ma and me was booked for it and no
escape because of my contract with him. And
it was some party and at twelve o'clock that
night I dragged my weary bones down the corridor
after the second day of my rest, feeling
that I would pass out any minute. A person
certainly does need their strength to enjoy a
American health resort.</p>

<p>The next morning I didn't even attempt to
get up for any wild west exhibit. I hadn't the
pep for one thing and the Captain was another
reason of course. And when I finally come
down-stairs and see Ma eat practically nothing,
I let her set off right away after breakfast
without me for exercise was nothing in my life.
I strolled around the lobby waiting for Maison
Rosabelle according to her request and there I
seen a big poster which I had noticed before,
the one about the entertainment for the benefit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of blind soldiers which the Captain had been
sitting under the first time I&mdash;he saw me, and
I went over and read it and the entertainment
was to come off that very night. And while
I was reading it the second time the way a person
does in a hotel lobby, up comes Captain
Raymond and actually speaks right there
where a sceene would of proved me no lady.</p>

<p>"Please, Miss LaTour!" he says. "It's so
<i>important.</i>"</p>

<p>"Kindly do not force me to call for assistance,"
I says low and quiet. "You are a
stranger to me."</p>

<p>"But you dont understand!" he says, flushing
up red the attractive way he had for all he
was so fresh.</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," I says. "I havent been in
the theatrical world since three generations for
nothing," I says. "Kindly go <i>away!</i>"</p>

<p>"If you would only listen for five minutes,
I'd prove how mistaken you are!" he says.
"Won't you give me a chance?"</p>

<p>"No!" I says.</p>

<p>"By Heavens, I'll make you!" he says, half
laughing. "I've never seen anything so absurd!
Why my dear lady...."</p>

<p>Right then up comes Maison in a simple little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Xmas tree of a dress in green and gold and
red, and I broke away and took her arm, and
hurried her out through the front door, leaving
the Captain staring after us and rather
against Maison's will.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you introduce me, dearie?" she
says. "I kind a thought you'd pick up that
bird!"</p>

<p>"I didn't pick him up. I turned him down!"
I snapped. But Maison kidded me the whole
three hours while we was in the beauty-parlours
getting waived and manicured.</p>


<h3>                      IV</h3>

<p>Then we had a nice wholesome little lunch
lasting only three hours and comparatively
quiet and by ourselves, seeing there was only
Goldringer and Ruby Roselle and Maison and
Freddy and O'Flarety, our leading juvenile
who had turned up, and Mr. Sternberger and
a friend of Ma's which used to be in the circus
with her, and Ma and myself. And all the
way through I watched Ma kind of anxiously,
for she only toyed with a little salad and passed
up everything else. I was by this time really
scared she would be haggard or something, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
she looked fine, and not a word of complaint
out of her, only toward four o'clock she got
kind of restless, and so did I, so we excused
ourselves, and walked to the door together.</p>

<p>"You needn't come along with me, Mary
Gilligan," she says. "I want to walk real
fast."</p>

<p>I looked at her sort of surprised at that, but
at the time the queerness didn't really sink in.
And I was so wore out I was actually glad to
let her go alone and personally, myself, I took
one of those overgrown baby-carriages or rolling
chairs which I thought a healthy young
person like myself would never come to, and
sank into it like the poor weary soul I was,
and let the coon tuck me in like a six-months-old,
and off we went as fast as a snail.</p>

<p>Well it was pleasanter than I had thought it
would be and I got kind of drowsy and dreamy
and somehow I couldnt help but think of Captain
Raymond and how refined and nice he was
and how my fame and beauty had captured
him to the extent that it had almost made him
forget to act like a gentleman, and how he persisted
like a regular story book hero. And I
wondered if he would shoot himself on my account,
and that threw a awful scare into me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
for handsome women have a terrible responsibility
in the way they treat men. And I wondered
was I really doing the right thing, taking
such a risk by treating him so sever and not
speaking and here he was in the service of his
country and all and Gawd knows I might be
wrecking his whole life from then on. And
furthermore I thought how hard it is to be refined
and what a lot a person has to sacrifice
to it, and that the roughnecks of this world
seem to have most of the fun. And that it was
certainly hard to be dignified but that my whole
career was built on my refinement no less than
my great talent, and I must respect my own
position. Ah well, uneasy lies the tooth that
wears a crown as the poet says, or something!</p>

<p>And by this time the coon had got tired
pushing me and turning my face sea-ward had
gone to take a rest and I took one too and
actually fell asleep.</p>

<p>When I woke up I was moving again, going
slow in the direction of the Inlet, and I felt
quite refreshed and happy, and the whole of
Atlantic City appeared to feel the same, for
everybody I passed smiled and seemed to be
enjoying theirselves. And they all seemed to
smile at me in such a sweet, friendly way it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
made my heart feel awful good. I was even
quite surprised because although of course I
am used to being recognized every place I go,
but still, more people than ever was doing it
this afternoon. I begun to think I must be
looking pretty good and that my hat, about
which I had had a few doubts, was a big success
after all. It really was a sort of triumphal
progress as the saying is, and I had
half a mind to turn around when we passed
the last pier; but the ocean looked so beautiful
and pink in the sunset and going the other way
it would of been in my eyes, so I just let myself
be rolled on and on until we was almost
to the Inlet and not a soul in sight. Then the
chair stopped and was turned against the rail.</p>

<p>"Now I've got you at last!" said a unexpected
voice, and around from the back came,
not the coon, but Captain Raymond.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?" I asked,
hardly able to speak.</p>

<p>"I have had the honor of pushing you into
this secluded corner of&mdash;of the ocean!" he said,
his blue eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;how . . ." I sputtered.</p>

<p>"I bought off the colored man while you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
were sleeping," he said. "And have been your
humble servant for almost an hour!"</p>

<p>Can you beat it? You cant!</p>

<p>"Well of all the nerve," I began, remembering
how people had smiled, and no wonder!</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Walk home this minute!" I says, struggling
with the rugs. But they had a will of their
own and it was on his side and I just couldnt
seem to get free of them.</p>

<p>"Oh I say, don't be so absurd!" he says smilingly.</p>

<p>"I'm not!" I says.</p>

<p>"Oh but you are!" he insisted. "Just sit still
and let me show you something!"</p>

<p>Well, there was nothing for me but to give
in or look a utter fool, and he <i>was</i> so attractive!
And, well anyways, I waited and he
brought out a letter from his overcoat pocket
and it was the very one he had wrote me first
and I had returned it to the hotel clerk.</p>

<p>"Please just open it!" he begged, and I did
and nearly fainted because inside was a letter
in Jim's handwriting addressed to me and introducing
Captain Charles Raymond who was
with him in France, only being gassed was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
home on leave and would I show him every
courtesy as he had been good to my ever loving
husband, Jim!</p>

<p>"And really and truly I wouldn't have been
so persistant, Miss LaTour," Captain Raymond
was saying as I looked up. "I had intended
using it when I got to New York of
course. But when they put me in charge of
this entertainment for the benefit of the blind,
and I discovered you were here, I was simply
determined to get you to take part in it.
Couldn't you do us just one little dance? It
would be such a drawing-card, your name
would. That was all I wanted, really!"</p>

<p>Believe you me I didn't know what to think
or how I felt. Did I feel flat? I did! Did
I feel relieved? I did!! So it wasnt a mash
at all, and for a moment I felt a lonelier war-widow
than ever. Then I remembered how
Jim said in the note to be nice to this bird, and
I could see, now that I looked at him good,
that he was the sort which it is perfectly safe
to be nice to. Not that he didnt admire me,
either, but that he was just as refined as me
and more so and was Jim's pal beside. So I
says yes, of course I would dance, and we
talked and talked and the sun went down, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
got to be real friends and was it good to hear
about Jim, first hand? <b>IT WAS</b>! And after
a while we commenced to walk back toward the
hotel, pushing the chair, and the lights was all
lit along the walk like Fairyland, and also in
the shops so they was more like show-cases
than ever. And then I got the second shock
of the afternoon because at ten past six with
dinner at seven, there was Ma in the Ocean
Lunch eating griddle-cakes, fish-balls, Salsbury
steake and coffee, with a little strained
honey and apple-pie on the side! No wonder
she could diet so good! And I take it to my
credit that, since she did not notice me, I never
let on that I seen her, not then nor afterward
at dinner when she refused everything but two
dill pickles!</p>

<p>But it wasn't until afterward when I was
in the star dressing-room at the Apollo Theatre,
putting on my make-up for the benefit that
the real blow came. I was just about ready to
go on when in rushed Goldringer, all breathless
with a cablegram in his hand.</p>

<p>"Its all right about Olivette Twist!" he
puffed at me. "We'll begin making that
fillum Tuesday!" and he threw the message<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
down on my dressing table. It was signed by
our London manager and it read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Present location of Charles Dickens uncertain
but material is uncopyrighted, shoot."</p>

<p>And so immediately after the show, myself
and Ma went back to New York to get a twenty-four
hour rest before commencing work
again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

                           <h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Believe</span> you me, the world to-day is just
about as settled as a green passenger on a trip
to Bermuda. There is that same awful feeling
of not knowing is something going to happen
or not&mdash;do you get me? You do! And it
can't help but strike even a mere womanly
woman and lady like I, that unless the captain
and officers keep a firm hand on the crew until
we get a little ballast in the hold, we are likely
to get in Dutch. Not meaning the Germans
necessarily, but the Russians, or something
just as bad. And perhaps it may seem strange
for me to know about them nautchical terms,
but anybody which has once been to Bermuda
learns what ballast is on account of their not
having hardly any on them boats because of the
water not being deep enough, and believe you
me, nothing I had to do in the fillum we made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
after what was left of us arrived there, and it
was some fillum at that&mdash;$1000. for bathing
costumes alone and me as "The Sea King's
Conquest" in silver scales, although hardly
knowing how to swim&mdash;was a patch on the
treatment which that unballasted boat handed
me on the trip down.</p>

<p>Well anyways, even when sitting in the security
of my flat on the Drive, which Gawd
knows it aught to be secure what with the salary
I get and moving-pictures will be the last
thing the common people will give up;&mdash;even
with this security and the handsomest furniture
any installment house could provide, and every
other equipment which is necessary to one so
prominent in my line as myself, still even in
the scarcity of the home, as the poet says, I
am conscious that the world is, or could quite
easily be, on the blink.</p>

<p>And ain't it the truth? Even the simplest
soul, buried in the wilds of Broadway and
wholly absorbed in their own small life must
feel the unrest. No use kidding ourselves
about it. It's time for all good Americans to
quit fighting among theirselves and come to
the aid of the country. Regardless of race,
creed or color, as the free hospital says, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Gawd knows the hospital will be where they'll
land if they don't. Do you get me? Probably
not. What I mean is, it's time we quit
talking and <i>did</i> something. What? I dunno,
quite, but it was this general line of thought,
which come to me while listening to the director
give me my instructions for the ball-room
scene in "The Dove of Peace," where I catch
the Russian Ambassador giving the nitro-glycerine
or some other patent face-cleanser to
the fake Senator, caused me to reform the
White Kittens. That and Ma's peculiar behavior,
plus the new cook.</p>

<p>You see it come over me all of a sudden that
we ladies have now a vote and so forth, which
unquestionably makes us more or less citizens
the same as the men, and if the country went
bluey, why wouldn't it be our fault as well?
And I come to this partially through the sense
of unrest and having eat something that didn't
settle good and Ma's behavior. All coming
at once they kind of got together and exploded
into my idea.</p>

<p>Well anyways, I had just come to a place in
my personal life where I seen a little peace and
quiet ahead and nothing to do but go up in an
aeroplane for the second reel of "The Dove."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
The war was over without Jim being killed in
it and a new chance offered by a big picture
contract the minute his uniform should be off
him; I was going strong with nothing but
Broadway releases and a salary which made
Morgan jealous; my spring clothes hadn't a
failure among them and only one of my hats
was too tight in the head. The fool dogs was
both healthy, the cook had stayed a month;
the car had been in order for over three weeks,
and I had successfully nursed Ma through the
flu. And I thought fat could not harm me,
as the poet says, for I had dieted to-day. When
all of a sudden Ma, who had hardly got over
the Influenza, come down with Bolshevism.</p>

<p>Now the trouble with these new diseases is
that the doctors don't seem to know anything
about them nor what makes them catching.
At least that is the line of talk they pull, but
I got a hunch myself, that if the flu had been
quarantined right in the first place it could of
been stopped. Do you get me? You do! And
I will say one more word in favor of Influenza.
You was obliged to report it, if only to the
Board of Health. But Bolshevism seems to
be like a cold in the head. If you catch it,
that evidently is nobody's business but your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
own; if you spread it&mdash;the same. Then again
folks are kind of proud of having had the flu.
It makes conversation and everything, and one
which has escaped feels a little mortified like
admitting they had never seen Charlie Chaplin.
Indeed, people certainly do get a lot of
pleasure out of illness and etc. And so long
as it is under control, all right, leave them enjoy
theirselves. They had to suffer first and
mabe a little talk is coming to them.</p>

<p>But with this Bolshevism it's the other way
around. The talk comes first, but believe you
me, the suffering will come afterwards. And
if they could only be made to realise this ere too
late, a whole lot of patients would be cured
before they got it. A ounce of Americanism
is worth a pound of red propaganda, as the
poet says, or would of had he written to-day.</p>

<p>Things started with Ma as per usual upsetting
the cook which has come to be a habit with
her, for cooking is to Ma what his art is to
Caruso&mdash;naught but death could tear her from
it permanent. And while I give her credit for
trying in every way to be an idle rich, the
kitchen might as well be furnished with magnets
and she a nail for all she can keep out of
it with the natural result that keeping out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
it is the best thing the cooks we hire do. And
I can't say with any truth that I have made as
much effort to break her of that as of some
other lack of refinements, such as remembering
that toothpicks ain't a public utility and never
to say "excuse my back," or keep her knife and
fork for the next course at the Ritz. Because
believe you me, Ma is some cook and a real
authograph dinner by her is something to bring
tears of sweet memory to the eyes of the older
generation and leave us young things in sympathetic
wonder about them dear dead days
when first class home-cooking was a custom,
not a curiosity. And so while the material side
of life don't interest me much, what with my
work and etc. to take my mind off it, still even
a artist must eat or Gawd knows where the
strength to act in the "Dove of Peace" or any
other six-reeler would come from if I didn't,
and Ma's is that simple nourishing kind, but
with quality, the same as the sort of dresses I
wear&mdash;made out of two dollars worth of material
and a thousand dollar idea.</p>

<p>Well anyways, our latest cook which had a
husband in the service and had took up her
work again so's to release him for the front at
Camp Mills, for he got no further, heard he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
was coming back home, having got his discharge
and it upset her so but whether from
joy or rage, I don't know which, that there
was nothing to eat in the kitchen but a little
liquor she had left at seven-thirty, when we
went in to see what was the cause of delay, and
me with Maison Rosabelle and a friend to dinner.
So Ma woke her up out of her emotions
which she claimed had overcome her, and give
her a honorable discharge of her own and then
turned up the ends of her sleeves, and only a
little hampered by the narrow skirt to the green
satin evening gown she had on her, give us a
meal as per above described. And no one
would of cared how long it was before the intelligence
office&mdash;I mean domestic, not U.S.
Army&mdash;sent us a cook but that in trying to
save her dress Ma got hot grease on her right
hand and that changed the situation because we
had to call up next day and take anything they
had&mdash;and they sent us up a German woman.</p>

<p>Well, believe you me, that was a shock because
I had an idea that all the Germans in the
country was either interned or incognito, but
this one wasn't even disguised, which isn't so
remarkable on account of her being pretty near
as big as Ma and a voice on her like a fog-horn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
with a strong accent on the fog. I never in my
life see so many bags and bundles and ecteras
as that female had with her, for she was undoubtedly
one, although she had a sort of
moustache beside the voice. But what she had
in voice she certainly lacked in words. When
Ma set out to ask her the usual questions which
everybody does, although their heart is trembling
with fear, she won't take the job, this
lady Hun didn't divulge no more information
about herself than we asked. She was as stingy
with her language as if it had been hard liquor.
Ma asked her to come in, and she did, and sat
without being asked upon one of the gold chairs
in the parlor which I certainly never expected
it would survive the test, they being made for
parlor rather than sitting room.</p>

<p>Well anyways, it's a fact she certainly was
a mountain and if she were a fair specimen, all
this about the Germans starving to death is
the bunk. Only her being over here may of
made a difference. Well, after she had set
down a bundle done up in black oil-cloth, a cute
little hand-bag about a yard long made out of
somebody's old stair-carpet, a shoe-box with a
heel of bread sticking out at one end, an umbrella
which looked like a sea-side one, a pot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
white hyacinths in full bloom and a net-bag
full of little odds and ends, she still had an old
black pocket-book and a big bulky bundle done
up in a shawl lying idly in her lap. After I
had taken all this in, I gave her personally the
once-over and was surprised to see she wasn't
so old as her figure, or anything like it. For
by the size of her she might of been the Pyramids,
but her face was quite young and if she
had been a boy I would of said the moustache
was the first cherished down.</p>

<p>"What's your name, dearie?" says Ma, which
I simply can't learn her not to be familiar
with servants.</p>

<p>"Anna," says the lump.</p>

<p>"And where do you come from?" says Ma,
giving a poor imitation of a detective.</p>

<p>"Old Country," says Anna. Well, Ma and
me at once exchanged glances, putting name
and place together.</p>

<p>"German?" says Ma. "Of course!"</p>

<p>"Swedish," says Anna, more lumpishly than
ever.</p>

<p>And just at that moment the air was filled
with a big laugh that none of us there had give
voice to. It was <i>some</i> shock, that laugh, and
Ma and me looked around expecting to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
who had come into the room, but it was nobody.
Anna was the only one who didn't seem
disturbed. She just went on sitting.</p>

<p>"Who was that?" says Ma.</p>

<p>"It must of been outside," I says, for it was
warm and we had the windows open so's to
let in the gasoline and railroad smoke and a
little fresh air.</p>

<p>"I guess so," says Ma. Then she went back
to her third-degree.</p>

<p>"So you're Swedish!" says Ma. "Can you
cook?"</p>

<p>"Good!" says Anna. "Svell cook!"</p>

<p>"Well, dearie!" says Ma, "why was it you
left your last place?"</p>

<p>"Too hot!" says Anna. And again me and
Ma exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"Are you a good American?" says Ma.</p>

<p>"Good American-Swedish," says Anna. And
immediately that awful laugh was repeated.
This time it was in the room, no doubt about
it. And yet no one was there outside ourselfs.</p>

<p>"My Gawd!" says Ma. "What was it?"</p>

<p>"Somebody is hid some place!" I says. "And
I'd like to know who is it with the cheap sense
of humor?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"It bane Frits," says Anna. "Na, na,
Frits!"</p>

<p>"But where on earth . . ." I was commencing,
when I noticed Anna was unwinding the
shawl off the package in her lap. And then
in another moment we seen Frits for our own
selves, for there he was, a big moth-eaten parrot,
interned in a cage, making wicked eyes
at us and giving us the ha-ha like the true Hun
he was!</p>

<p>"Frits and me, we stay!" announced Anna
comfortably. "We stay!"</p>

<p>"But look here," says I, "we didn't start
out to hire any parrots."</p>

<p>"Why Mary Gilligan!" says Ma, and I
could see she was scared that if Frits went
Anna would certainly go, too. "Why Mary
Gilligan, I thought you was fond of dumb animals!"
she says.</p>

<p>"And so I am," I says. "The dumber the
better. But this one is evidently far from it!
How am I going to figure out my income tax
with this bird hanging around?"</p>

<p>"Hang in den Kitchen!" says Anna firmly,
and at that we gave in, because cooks is cooks,
and what's a bird more or less after all? Still
I didn't like him on account of suspecting he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
wasn't a neutral any more than Anna was for
all she claimed to be a Swede. I had read a
piece in the paper about where the Germans
was pretending to be Swede or Spanish or anything
they could get away with so's to remain
free to spread Bolshevism and influenza and
bombs and send up the price of dry and fancy
goods and put through the Prohibition amendment
and all them other gentle little activities
for which they are so well and justly known.</p>

<p>But I thought knowledge is power as the
guy which wrote the copy-book says, and I had
the drop on Anna through being on to her disguise
and beside which I could see Ma was going
to be miserable if she had to eat out while
her hand was in the sling, and so we took the
viper to our bosom, or in other words, we hired
her, and anyways, she had already accepted
the job and it would of been a lot of trouble
to get her out by force. Which, believe you
me, a person seldom has to do with servants
now-a-days, and confirmed me about her being
German because naturally people don't
hire them, if acknowledging to themselves that
they <i>are</i> Germans any more than they would
now deliberately import sauerkraut or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
other German industry. Do you get me?
You'd better!</p>

<p>But in this case there was a reasonable doubt
together with a real necessity, although from
what come of it, I feel, looking backwards, it
would of been better to eat out and suffer than
to of compromised with our patriotic consciences
like we done at that time. Because
there is <i>no</i> reasonable doubt but that Anna's
coming into the house was greatly responsible
for Ma's catching Bolshevism.</p>


<h3>                    II</h3>

<p>Not that she caught it off Anna directly,
because for once we had a cook which couldn't
talk or understand American and so there was
no use in Ma's hanging around the kitchen
worrying the life out of her. And so the very
first morning Anna was on the premises, Ma
commenced hanging around and worrying the
life out of me.</p>

<p>It happened we was waiting for the aeroplane
I was to go up in to arrive at the studio,
and so for once having my morning for myself,
I thought I would just dash off my income
tax return, and be done with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>But it seems that this is one of the things
which is easier said than done, the same as
signing the peace-treaty, and believe you me,
the last ain't got a thing on the former and I
don't know did Pres. Wilson make out his own
income tax return or not. But if he did and
the collector of Internal Revenue left him get
by with it as he must of or why would the Pres.
be in Paris, which is out of the country, well
anyways, if the Pres. did it alone, believe you
me, he will get away with the treaty all right,
and probably even write in this here Leg of
Nations under table 13, page 1, of return and
instructions page 2 under K (b) without having
to ask anybody how to do it, he having undoubtedly
shown the power to think.</p>

<p>Well anyways, I had taken all the poker-chips,
silk-sale samples, old theatre programs
and etc., out of my desk, found my fountain
pen and a bottle of ink, and was turning that
cute little literacy test around and over to see
where would I commence and had got no further
than the realization that most of my brains
is in my feet instead of behind my face, when
Ma comes in and commences worrying me because
she could not cook nor yet crochet like
the lillies of the field, or whatever that well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
idle flower was. I tried to listen at least
as politely as is ever required of a daughter to
her mother, but when I was trying to figure
out my answer to question No. 5 and getting
real mad over its personalness, I couldn't stand
to hear her complain over not being able to
crochet them terrible mats she makes which
are not fit for anything except Xmas presents,
anyways.</p>

<p>"The trouble with you, Ma," I snapped at
last, "is that you aught to get a live-wire outside
interest. You're getting out of date.
Ladies don't crochet no more and even knitting
has been dished by the armistice. You never
read a newspaper or a book. You should go
in for something snappy and up to the moment
like literature or jobs for soldiers, or
business, or something."</p>

<p>This got Ma's goat right off, like I hoped it
would.</p>

<p>"Oh, so I'm on the shelf, am I?" she says,
"well, leave me tell you Mary Gilligan, if it
wasn't for us back numbers you new numbers
wouldn't even <i>be</i> here, don't forget that! And
after having been the first American lady to
do the double backward leap on the two center
trapeses, I can hardly be called a dead one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
even if a little heavier than I was. And
from that time on I have never ceased to be
forward."</p>

<p>"You'd have to show me," I says, grimly.</p>

<p>"All right, I will," she says.</p>

<p>And believe you me, she did. She went and
got on her dolman and her spring hat and left
me in wrath and the midst of that income tax
with that "I'll never come back" air so familiar
to all well-regulated families.</p>

<p>Well, as I sat there struggling over where
to put the × and = marks, and how much exemption
could I get away with and still be on
speaking terms with myself, and wondering
whether the two fool dogs was dependents or
not&mdash;which they aught to be, seeing how helpless
they are and a big expense and Gawd
knows I keep them only for appearances and
they aught to come under the head of professional
expenditures, because no well-known
actress but has them to help out the scenery&mdash;well
anyways, I was deep in this highly high-brow
occupation in the comparatively perfect
silence of my exclusive flat where ordinarily
we don't hear a thing but the neighbors' pianola
and the dumb-waiter and the auto horns on the
drive and the train just beyond&mdash;well, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
comparatively for New York, perfect silence
was broke by an awful yell in the apartment
itself.</p>

<p>"Anarchy!" a terrible voice hollered. And
then again "Anarchy! Anarchy!"</p>

<p>Believe you me, my blood turned to lemon
soda for a moment and the boys in the trenches
never had worse crawling down the back than
me at that minute, coming as it did right on
top of me, writing in opposite to B. income
from salaries&mdash;you know&mdash;$60,000.00. The silence
which followed was even worse. And I
sat there sort of frozen while expecting a bomb
would go off any minute, and Gawd knows
sixty thousand is a lot of money, but any one
which investigated the true facts could quickly
see that I earn every cent of it and anyways
brains has a right to the bigger share, not to
mention ability, and if the way I worked myself
up from the lower classes ain't proof of
what can be done single-handed in America, I
don't know what is, and anybody which works
as hard and lives as decent as I done can do the
same, not that I want to hand myself anything
extra, only speaking personally, I am in a position
to know.</p>

<p>But just the same I wasn't reasoning at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
minute and the justice, as you might say, of my
case didn't occur to me until later. As I sat
there trying to remember to think, the voice
yells it again, only this time with additions.</p>

<p>"Anarchy! Love Anarchy! Pretzel!"</p>

<p>And then I realised it was that parrot belonging
to the new cook.</p>

<p>Can you imagine my feelings on top of my
suspicions of her? You can! I got up and
went into the kitchen to see if a bomb was may
be being prepared for our dinner, but not at
all. The kitchen was scrubbed to the last tile,
something that smelled simply grand was baking,
the white hyacinths was in the sun on the
window-sill, and Anna was humming under her
breath while she rolled out biscuit-dough. The
radical parrot was shut up, but only as to
mouth, he being loose and walking about the
top of the clothes-wringer, making himself very
much at home, and giving me <i>some</i> evil look as
I come in.</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid he'll get away?" I says.</p>

<p>"Huh?" says Anna, stopping rolling, and
blinking at me.</p>

<p>"Lose him&mdash;parrot&mdash;&mdash;!" I says, pointing to
him and flapping my arms like wings.</p>

<p>"Frits?" she said. "Na&mdash;Frits like liberty!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>And that was all I could get out of her. I
stuck around for a few minutes more, until
Anna commenced to give me the cook's-eye,
that bird backing her up and sneering at me
while dancing slowly on the wringer, but not
moving a step. So I got out and back to the
parlor but not to my work which Gawd knows
I had to take it over to the bank and leave them
do it for me after all&mdash;but sat down instead to
consider them two suspicious birds in the back
part of the flat. I personally myself was convinced
that there was something very wrong
about Anna. But so far she had said nothing
under the espionage law exactly and I didn't
know could you arrest a bird for too much liberty
of speech even though it loved anarchy,
and liberty and everything and was undoubtedly
capable of spreading propaganda what
with the voice it had.</p>

<p>Well anyways, as I was holding my marcelle
wave with both hands and racking what
little was underneath it over the situation, I
heard the key in the lock and in come Ma all
flushed and cheerful and pleased with herself
and handed me another jolt.</p>

<p>"I had a real sweet, pleasant morning," she
says, taking off her gloves and hat and wiping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
her face with one of them big handkerchiefs
like she used to carry in the circus and
will not give up. "A real nice time," she says,
egging me on to question her.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" I says, like she
wanted me to.</p>

<p>"Oh, just to a little Bolsheviki meeting,"
she says, casual. And picking up her things
she started for her room.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Ma!" I says, having managed to
get my breath before she reached the door.
"Say that again, will you?"</p>

<p>She turned and come back at that, still keeping
up the careless stuff.</p>

<p>"Certainly," she says, "Bolsheviki meeting.
Are you interested in this up-to-date stuff?"</p>

<p>"Interested!" I says. "Of course I am. I'm
against it. Why Ma Gilligan!" I says. "Do
you know what Bolshevism <i>is?"</i></p>

<p>"Do you?" says Ma, sweetly.</p>

<p>"No!" says I. "And neither do they. But
I am sure it's the bunk, and I feel it's wrong,
and I am ashamed of you going!"</p>

<p>"How old-fashioned of you, dearie," says
Ma. "Have you ever heard a speaker or been
to a meeting?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't need to!" I says short, being kind
of at a loss.</p>

<p>"Well, I have!" says Ma, triumphant.</p>

<p>"Where was it at?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Down to the circus," says Ma. "In the
Bear-wrestler's dressing room. I went to call
on some of the folks and get the news and Madame
Jones, the new automobile act&mdash;very distinguished
lady&mdash;got me to it. A most exclusive
affair, with only the highest priced acts
invited!"</p>

<p>"And who spoke?" I says.</p>

<p>"Kiskoff, the bear-wrestler," says Ma. "It
certainly was interesting."</p>

<p>"What did he say?" I says, it getting harder
and harder to remember I was a lady and she
my only mother. "What did he say?"</p>

<p>"I dunno!" says Ma.</p>

<p>"You don't know!" I fairly yells. "And
why don't you know?"</p>

<p>"Because he only talks Russian!" says Ma,
and walked out, leaving me flat.</p>

<p>Well, believe you me, I was that upset I
scarcely took any notice of my lunch, although
it was a real nice meal, commencing with some
juicy kind of fish and eggs and ending up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
pancakes rolled up and filled with cream curds
and powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Ma took to these eats immensely, and she
and Anna exchanged a couple of smiles, which
made me feel like the only living American.
And when later in the day Ma told me she
thought she'd join the Bolshevists if she didn't
have to be immersed, and that this Kiskoff's
life was in danger for his beliefs just like the
early Romans and nobody knew where he lived,
but was a man of mystery, I couldn't stand it
another moment, but beat it for a long walk
by myself because my nerves was sure on edge
and that aeroplane stunt facing me next week.</p>

<p>But the walk wasn't altogether pleasant,
at least not at the start or at the finish, because
when I come out of our palatial near-marble
front stoop, there was a guy standing
which might just as well of had on the brass-buttons
and all because you could tell at once
by the disguise that he was a plain-clothes cop.
Not that I am so familiar with them, but their
clothes is generally so plain any one could tell
them. Do you get me? You do!</p>

<p>Well anyways, this bird was standing opposite
our door, and at the second glance I had
him spotted or nearly so, and when I come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
back from walking fast and wishing to Gawd
Jim was back to advise me and occupying our
flat instead of Germany, the fly-cop was still
there by which I became certain he was one;
the more so as I watched him from a window
once I was in, and the way he kept camouflaging
himself as a casual passer-by, ended my
doubts.</p>

<p>Well, was that some situation? It was!
Here was myself, a good American though but
an ignorant woman, surrounded by all the terrible
and disturbing elements of the day; with
everything which aught to be kept out of every
U. S. A. home creeping into mine, and all so
sudden that I hadn't got my breath yet much
less any action. In fact, I was sort of dizzy
with what was happening, and my head didn't
quiet down any when, after dinner that night,
I heard deep voices out in back.</p>

<p>"Anna has company!" says Ma in explanation.
"Two of them, and I think they are
talking Russian. At any rate one has a beard
almost as handsome as Mr. Kiskoff's."</p>

<p>This got my angora, and while no lady would
ever spy on her cook, this was surely a exception
and so I took a quiet peek in through the
pantry slide and there was Anna and two big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
he-men all talking at once. The window was
open a little ways from the top and on it was
Frits, also talking in Russian or something,
and no earthly reason why he couldn't take his
liberty and go right out if he had really wanted
it. And still another jolt was handed me when
I realised one of the men was our very own
ice-man!</p>

<p>Believe you me, when I went to bed that
night in my grey French enameled Empire
style I was wore out with the series of jolts
which the day has handed me. But it is not
my custom to sit back and talk things over too
long. I have ever noticed that the person which
talks too much seldom does a whole lot, and
that a quick decision if wrong, at least learns
you something, and you can start again on the
right track. And no later than the next day
after a funny, though good breakfast, of coffee
and new bread with cinnamon and sugar
baked into it and herrings in cream, I commenced
to act.</p>

<p>"Ma, are you going to keep up this Bolshevist
bull?" I says.</p>

<p>"I am!" she says. "You told me to do something
modern and I'm doing the very modernest
thing there is!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are going to be wrong on that by this
P. M.," I says, "or to-morrow at latest," I
says, "because there is or aught to be something
moderner, and that is United Americanism!"
I says. "And since the only way to fight
fire is with it, I am going to start a rival organization
and start it quick!" I says, "and
I'm going to do it on a sounder basis than your
people ever dreamed of because we'll all talk
English so's we'll each of us know what the organization
is about!"</p>

<p>"Why Marie La Tour!" says Ma, which it's
a fact she only calls me that when she's sore at
me. "Why, Marie La Tour, what is your organization
going to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet beyond one thing," I says,
"we are going to <i>get together</i> and keep together!"</p>

<p>And so, without waiting for a come-back or
any embarrassing questions, I hustled into a
simple little grey satin Trotteur costume which
is French for pony-clothes and left that homefull
of heavy-weight traitors where a radical
parrot yelled "Anarchy" from morning till
night, and even the steam radiators had commenced
to smell like dynimite. And having
shut the door after me with quite some explosion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
myself, I had the limousine headed to the
White Kittens Annual Ball Assn., which I was
due at it on account of all the most prominent
ladies in picture and theatrical circles being on
the committee and I naturally being indespensible
if only for the value of my name. So
I started off but not before I noticed that the
same plain-clothes John was again perched opposite
my front door.</p>


<h3>                     III</h3>

<p>All the way to the Palatial Hotel which the
meeting is always held in the grand ballroom
of, I kept getting more and more worked up.
Things had certainly gone too far when Bolshevism
had spread from the parlor to the
kitchen or visa-versa, I didn't know which, and
my own Ma being undoubtedly watched by
the more or less Secret Service, all because of
her having taken a fancy to them whiskers of
this Kiskoff cockoo, which is the only explanation
I could make of it, and after being a widow
twenty years she aught to of been ashamed of
herself. Still, it was a better explanation for
her to of lost her head than her patriotism,
and I tried to think this the case. And my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
position was something to bring tears to a
glass eye, what with my well-known war-work
and a perfectly good husband still in the
service. And I had made a threat to take action,
and had no idea what it would be, only
that now I certainly had to deliver the goods.</p>

<p>Well anyways, in despair and the limousine,
I finally arrived at the Palatial and there in
the lobby was several other White Kittens
which were also late, so we give each other's
clothes the once-over and asked after our
healths and etc., and then hurried up in the
elevator to where the meeting had already commenced.</p>

<p>Believe you me, my mind stuck to that meeting
about as good as a W.S.S. which has been
in your purse a month does when you find your
card. The room was as full as could be with
the biggest crowd I ever knew to turn out for
it. But somehow while I am generally pretty
well interested in any crowd, this time nothing
seemed to register except my own thoughts.
Even the chairlady couldn't hold my attention
partially because she was Ruby Roselle, and
what they wanted to elect that woman for I
don't know because her head is certainly not
the part of her which earned her theatrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
reputation and a handsome back is no disgrace
and if that and a handful of costume is art far
be it from me to say anything: but it is neither
refinement nor does it make a good executor
for a live organization like the Kittens. And
what is more, any woman which had her nose
changed from Jewish to Greek right in the
middle of a big feature fillum can't run any
society to suit me, not to mention the fact that
as I sat there watching her talk I come slowly
to realize that she had several jewels and a couple
of friends which was found to be pro-Germans
and been interned, although nothing was
ever proved onto Ruby herself.</p>

<p>Still, coming on top of what I had been going
through the last couple of days, I took a
sudden suspicion of her being lady-chairman
to one of America's oldest organizations of the
female gender, it having been formed 'way
back in 1911. And what is furthermore, as I
sat there hating her with her synthetic Christian
nose and her genuine Jewish diamonds,
the big idea come at last&mdash;a way to at once get
something started before she did, because how
did I know but she'd have the orchestra play
"die Watch on Rinewine," and feed us on
weenies and pumpernickle for supper at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
ball if something radical wasn't done at once?
That is, I mean radical in the right sense, of
course. So when she says "Any other remarks?"
I jumped to my feet quick before she
could say "the meeting is injoined."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Ruby Schwartz Roselle, there
is," I said. "I will be obliged to have the floor
a minute."</p>

<p>"You can have it for all of me, dearie," says
Ruby, sweetly, as she recognized her enemy.
"Miss Marie La Tour has the floor."</p>

<p>And then without hardly knowing what I
was doing and forgetting even to feel did my
nose need powder before I commenced, I began
talking with something fluttering inside
me like a bird's wing. You know&mdash;a feeling
like a try-out before a big-time manager. But
behind the scare, the strength of knowing you
can deliver the goods.</p>

<p>"Ladies and fellow or, I should say, sister-Kittens!"
I commenced. "There was a time
when the well-known words 'Now is the time
for all good men to come to the aid of the
party' so thrilled America that it has become
not alone printed in all copy books, but is the
first sentence which is learned by every typewriter.
But since then times have changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
until, believe you me, now is the time for all
good parties to come to the aid of the nation
in order to show all which are not Americans
first just where they get off, and ladies, we
here assembled are a party not to be scorned,
what with a sustaining membership of over five
hundred, and more than a thousand one-dollar
members. And what is more, though admittedly
mere females we have a vote in most
places now, including this state, and while I
have no doubt you have always intended to be
good citizens, having the vote you are now
obliged to be so."</p>

<p>There was quite a little clapping at this, so
I was encouraged to go on, although Ruby's
voice says "Out of Order!" twice. Well, I
couldn't see anybody that was behaving disorderly,
so I just went ahead with my idea.</p>

<p>"And so my idea is this," I says. "That all
Americans, whether lady or gentleman citizens,
should get together in one big association for
U. S. A. Actually get together instead of
leaving things be. An association is, as I
understand it, intended for purposes of association.
And why not simply associate each
association with every other, canning all small
private schemes and party interests on the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
grand common interest of Bolsheviking the
Bolsheviks? I'm sure that if all parties concerned
will forget they are Democrats or Republicans
or Methodists or Suffragists&mdash;even
whether they are ladies or gentlemen, and remember
they are Americans, nothing can ever
rough-house this country like Europe has been
in several places, for in Union is Strength, in
God we Trust, but He helps those who helps
themselves, and if we'll only drop our self-interests
and make the union our first idea, God
help the foreigners which tries to help themselves
to our dear country!"</p>

<p>By this time the girls was giving me a hand
the like of which I never had before on stage
or screen, because their hearts were in them.
Do you get me? You do! And it was quite
a spell before Ruby could get order, although
she kept pounding with the silver cat's-paw of
her office. Finally, when she could make herself
heard, she says very sarcastic,</p>

<p>"And how does Miss La Tour suggest we
commence?" she says.</p>

<p>"By unanimously voting ourselfs 'The
White Kittens Patriotic Association of America,'"
I says at once. "Call a extra meeting
to change the constitution temporarily from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
annual Balls and festivals for the benefit of
indignant members, to a association for associating
with other associations as before suggested.
Use part of the money from the ball
just arranged for, to advertise our idea in
newspapers and billboards, and believe you me,
by the time we ladies get that far, some gentleman's
association will be on the job to show
us a practical way to use ourselves!"</p>

<p>Well, the Kittens seemed to think this all
right, too, and in spite of Ruby, the next meeting
was called and we broke up in high excitement,
and I was surrounded by admiring
friends all anxious to tell me they felt the same
as me, and so forth and etc. And finally, after
I had been treated to lunch by several of them,
not including Ruby, I collapsed into my limousine,
and said home James, and set my face
flat-ward with a brave heart which knew no
fear on account of having accomplished something
worth while. Even the sight of the obtrusively
unobtrusive bull still waiting like the
wolf at the door, didn't dampen my spirit.</p>

<p>And it was not until I got upstairs that I
commenced realizing that my own home would
be the first place to set in order, and how could
I be a great American female leader with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Bolshevist mother and a German cook, and
how could I preach a thing with one hand and
not practice it with the other? Of course, I
could fire the cook, but how about Ma? It
was she herself settled that part of it the moment
I stepped into the parlor, for there she
was all alone except for the two dogs, and
what was more, all of a heap, beside.</p>

<p>"Well, thank goodness, you decided to come
home, Mary Gilligan!" she says. "Something
awful has happened!"</p>

<p>"Not Jim?" I gasps, my heart nearly stopping,
for he is always the first thing I think
of.</p>

<p>"Jim, nothing!" says Ma. "It's poor Kiskoff!"</p>

<p>"Oh, him!" I says, relieved. "What of it?"</p>

<p>"They arrested him this morning!" says Ma,
all broken up, the poor fish! "Arrested him
just before the meeting!"</p>

<p>"Good!" I says. "I knew they would. The
hound, he couldn't go around forever talking
Bolshevism!"</p>

<p>"It wasn't for that," says Ma.</p>

<p>"Then for what?" I says, blankly.</p>

<p>"For back alimony!" says Ma, almost in
tears. "It seems he married a girl out in Kan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>sas
several years ago, and they parted when
the circus left, and it wasn't Russian he was
talking, but Yiddish! He speaks English as
well as me."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you'll tell me next that he
wasn't talking Bolshevism," says I.</p>

<p>"He wasn't&mdash;he was only asking them to
join the circus-workers' union Local 21&mdash;"
says Ma. "He explained it all to the cops!"</p>

<p>"Ma!" I demanded solemnly, a light coming
over me. "Ma, have you honestly got any idea
what this Bolshevism <i>is?</i> Come on, own up!"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" she says. "It's something like
Spiritualism or devil-worship, ain't it? A sort
of fancy religion!"</p>

<p>"Nothing so respectable!" I says very sharp,
yet awful relieved that I had guessed the truth.
"No such thing. Bolshevism is Russian for
sore-head. Religion my eye! It's about as
much a religion as small-pox is!"</p>

<p>Oh! the handicap of having no education!
I certainly felt sorry for Ma. But I needn't
of because she give me one of them looks of
hers which always turns my dress to plaid calico
and pulls my hair down my back again.</p>

<p>"Well, daughter, why didn't you say so in
the first place?" she says, just as if she'd caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
<i>me</i> in a lie. But I let it pass and apologized,
I was so glad to find she was a fake. And Ma
promised to leave them low circus people alone
for a spell and come back to the White Kittens
again. I then announced I was going out
and fire Anna. At that a look of terror came
over Ma's face, and she restrained me by the
sleeve.</p>

<p>"Be careful how you go near that kitchen!"
she says warningly.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sakes, Ma!" I says. "What's
wronger than usual out there?"</p>

<p>"I dunno, but I think something is!" she
says. "I believe it's a bomb!"</p>

<p>"A bomb!" I says. "Whatter you mean?"</p>

<p>"Anna is out to market," says Ma, "and
the one with the black beard like poor Kiskoff's
brought it. 'For Anna,' says he, and
shoved it at me, and snook off down the stairs
like a murderer."</p>

<p>"Brought <i>what?"</i> I says.</p>

<p>"The bomb, of course!" says Ma, impatient
herself.</p>

<p>"How do you know it's one?" I says, a little
uneasy and wishing I had fired Anna before
she got this swell chance of firing us.</p>

<p>"Well, it looks just like the one in the picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
where them three Germans blew theirselves
up in the newspaper!" says she. "And
it ticks."</p>

<p>"My Gawd!" I says. "Where is the thing?"</p>

<p>"On the kitchen-table," says Ma.</p>

<p>"Well," I says, bravely. "I think I aught
to take a look at it anyways."</p>

<p>"I wished you wouldn't," says she. But
she came down the hall after me like the loyal
mother she is, and the two of us stopped at the
threshhold as the poet says.</p>

<p>And there, sure enough, in the middle of
the spotless oilcloth on the kitchen table lay
a mighty funny looking package, about the
size of a dish-pan and done up in that black
oil-cloth them foreigners seem so fond of.
And between yells from that radical parrot,
who commenced his "I love Anarchy!" the
moment he set eyes on us, we could hear that
evil-looking package tick as plain as day.</p>

<p>Well, what with a mother and a father both
practically born on the centre trapese and used
myself to taking chances since early childhood,
I don't believe I'm more of a coward than most.
But I will admit my heart commenced going
too quick at that sight and the radical bird
was as usual loose in the place, and didn't make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
my nerves any easier. But a stitch in time
often saves a whole pair of silk ones, and remembering
this, I took some quick action. I
turned up my georgette crepe sleeves, and the
front of my skirt so's not to splash it, and made
straight for the sink, keeping my eye on the
centre-table all the while.</p>

<p>"Look out!" screams Ma. "What are you
going to do?"</p>

<p>"Throw cold water on it!" I says. And
filling the dish-pan I took a long sling with
it, and pretty near drowned the kitchen table,
to say nothing of the scare I threw into Frits.
As soon as he quit, we listened again, but
my efforts had been in vain, for the thing
was still ticking&mdash;slow, loud ticks, and very
alarming.</p>

<p>"No good!" I says, sadly. "We'll have to
take severer measures!"</p>

<p>"Well, what'll they be?" says Ma.</p>

<p>"There's a plain-clothes cop outside looking
for trouble," says I grimly, "and here is
where I hand him a little," says I.</p>

<p>And then, without waiting even to roll down
the georgettes, I hurried to the window and
looked out. Like most cops, he couldn't be
seen at first when wanted, but finally he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
into view and I tried to catch his attention,
but was unable to at first. But finally he
heard me and looked up, and I beckoned.</p>

<p>"Bomb!" I says. "Hurry up!"</p>

<p>And did he hurry? He did! I would not
of believed a man his size could do it, but he
must of beat the elevator, for it never brought
me up that fast. When I let him in, his lack
of surprise was the most alarming thing which
had yet been pulled. He evidently <i>expected</i>
a bomb to be here.</p>

<p>"By golly, we'll get them now!" he says
triumphantly. "We been watching this place
for two months on account of having it
straight that there is a bunch of Bolshevist
bomb makers in this building or the next one,
and this is the first time anything has stirred!
Where is your bomb? Lead me to it!"</p>


<h3>                    IV</h3>

<p>Well, I didn't lead him exactly. Since he
was so set up about it, I let him go ahead, but
Ma and me followed close behind and told
him the way and everything. When he came
to the kitchen door Frits let out a yell "Anarchy!
I love Anarchy!" and you aught to of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
seen the cop stagger in his tracks for a minute.
But he came to immediate, and we all stood
at attention while he give that bundle the once-over.
It was ticking away as strong as ever.</p>

<p>"Hey! get me a pail of water, quick!" says
the cop. I did it, and then, I will certainly
give him credit for it, he grabbed up the bundle
and plunged it in with both hands just as
Anna come in at the door.</p>

<p>Believe you me, I never saw anything so
funny as what happened then. The cop took
his hands out the water and stood there dripping
and staring at her.</p>

<p>"Hello, Anna!" he says. "What you doing
here?"</p>

<p>"Ay bane working!" says Anna. "How you
bane, Mike?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good!" he says. "But kind of busy
with a bomb we got here. Stand off while I
take a look. It has quit ticking and I guess
it's drownded!"</p>

<p>He lifted the wet bundle out, and the minute
Anna sees it she set up a yell as good as
one of her pet parrot's.</p>

<p>"That bane mine!" she says, making a grab
for it. But Mike held her off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yours, eh?" he says, severely. <i>"Yours!</i>
Well, we'll just have a look at it, my girl!"</p>

<p>With which he undid the string, unfolded the
oilcloth, and there was a big new alarm-clock
with the price still on it&mdash;2 beans&mdash;and a
round, heavy cheese!</p>

<p>"Bane youst a present from may feller!"
says Anna coyly.</p>

<p>Well, did we feel cheap? We did. And
in addition to that Mike, the smart and brave
young cop, was disappointed something terrible.</p>

<p>"Who is this Anna?" I asked him soon's I
got my breath.</p>

<p>"Oh, a Swede girl&mdash;I know her a long time,"
he says foolishly. "Used to entertain me in
the basement when I was on the regular force.
She's <i>some</i> cook! You're lucky to have her."</p>

<p>And just then this ex-pro-German Bolshevist
cook we was so lucky to have starts to yell
again!</p>

<p>"Frits! Oy! Frits!" she says. "He bane
gone! Make un yoump back!"</p>

<p>And sure enough, there was Frits on the
fire-escape of the flat next to us. He had give
one hop and a flutter and got across, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
sat, silent for once in his life and giving us
the evil-eye.</p>

<p>"Yoump back," says the cook in passionate
entriety. "Yoump back to your Aniky that
you love! All day you yell you love may an'
now you leave may!"</p>

<p>And as she said them words still another
weight was lifted from my shoulders, although
not from hers, for instead of jumping
back, that radical bird which it seemed was
not a radical after all and acting like the most
conventional parrot in the world, commenced
to climb up the fire-escape of the other apartment
house, like he was leaving us forever.</p>

<p>"Yoump!" implored Anna, but he just
climbed, instead.</p>

<p>"Here, wait, and I'll get him!" says Mike.
"Glad to do it, Anna. I can step across easy
enough!"</p>

<p>Anna held his coat, and he swung hisself over
to the other side almost as neat as a picture-actor,
and commenced following that mean-hearted
bird up and up, story after story, until
that animal led him in at a open window
about three flats above. We waited in silence
and, believe you me, I had about commenced
to believe that bird and he was never coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
out again, when down comes Mike, the bird
tucked into his vest, his face simply purple
with excitement. I never seen any acrobat
work swifter or quieter than he did. He landed
on the kitchen floor and closed the window
behind him before he even give Anna her bird.</p>

<p>"The telephone!&mdash;quick! The telephone&mdash;headquarters
at once&mdash;I've got that guy this
time at last! And to think that a damn bird
had to find him for me!"</p>

<p>And it was the truth. Frits, far from being
an alien, was a good little American parrot
and had actually led the cop to the very place
he had been looking for all that while, and
they arrested two guys and everything!</p>

<p>And after they got through the phone rang
and there was Goldringer's voice.</p>

<p>"The aeroplane has come, Miss La Tour,"
he says. "When will you be over?"</p>

<p>"First thing in the morning!" I says, relieved
to think of a quiet day ahead. Ain't it
grand to have work you love to do? It's so
restful!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

                           <h2>VI</h2>


                      <h3>THE GLAD HAND</h3>


                            <h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I see</span> a piece in the paper where that ex-leading
headliner of the old German Big-Time
Circuit, William Hohenzollern, him that used
to appear in the spiritualistic act known as
"Me and God," claims he had no hand in
starting those fireworks in Europe which has
recently ended in a Fourth of July celebration.
And although myself a good American
and looking with doubt upon any statement
known to be German, I am sort of inclined
to believe him. At any rate, to believe that
he was not the whole cheese in the matter, but
only a sort of limp limberger, or swiss, and
full of holes. Because it's my experience personally
myself, that a strong personality with
a clean-cut idea can usually get a thing done
if they elect theirself boss and stick on the
job until it is finished, but if they call a committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
meeting and discuss the action before
them, the whole idea is likely to get stalled.
Why, look at Congress! Not that I, being
a mere lady of the female sect, know why or
how they get stalled, or on just what. But
it's a cinch they do and are, and you can prove
it by any editorial page in the country. And
it seems that Billy the Bone-head, confessed
to the reporter, which managed to get this
Sunday story printed, that a committee meeting
of Yonkers or something was called about
the war, he, Bill the Badman, not having the
bean to go to it alone, and it was them ruined
the war, or so he says. Which goes to show
that not alone in the theatrical and moving-picture
worlds do the heads of departments
alibi their flivvers, but also in the King-business,
and it's a habit which may even yet ruin
the former, as it pretty near has the latter,
unless they quit shirking and deliver better
goods. Because if the Head Has-Been had
had any real thinker and had thought up the
war all by his little self and forced it on his
book-keeper, cashier and so forth, he might of
got away with it like Napoleon and Rockefeller
and Eva Tanguay and a lot of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
which has thrust riches and success upon theirselves.</p>

<p>But no committee can ever do that sort of
thing. It takes a single-handed personality,
and I guess mabe the biggest bluff Germany
has had to confess to is her ex-leader. He
seems the A-1 example of how true it is that
well-known tailors' ad, "Clothes make the
man." Also it inspires me to invent a quotation
to hang beside the famous one of Shakespeare's,
I think it is "Do it now!" which you
see so often, mine being "Do it yourself!"
Well, you will if you are the able one on a
committee. Everybody which has served on
one knows that every committee is composed
of the one which does all the work and three to
six others which uses most of their vitality and
imagination in thinking up excuses and offering
them.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, the foregoing is why I simply
eliminated the other members of my
Theatrical Ladies' Committee of Welcome to
Our Returning Heroes. And eliminating
them was so simple, too. I just didn't call any
committee. And why would I, what with the
knowledge I had gained through former experiences?
Believe you me, a lady which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
learns by experience is a great little time-saver,
although admittedly rare, but in my line you
don't fall out of a air-plane more than once,
and any successful picture actress and dancer
like myself will tell you the same. So as to
committees, none for me, thanks just the same,
as the man said to the soda clerk the morning
of July first, 1919 A. D., which is Latin
for Anti-Drinking. Not that I will ever again
try to get into the strong-character class with
the aforementioned celebrities, for a reputation
for doing anything well is as good as a
signed contract to do it. And my advice to
young girls is, don't let it be known you can
do anything well or you'll have to deliver constantly.
Look as ignorant as possible whenever
anything is suggested except the thing
you are burning to get after, or your time will
be taken up with a lot of useless side-lines that
get you nowheres. There is a person for every
job if you just let the job alone until the right
person finds it. Did you ever notice the way
simps which can't do a thing always get it
done for them? You have! Well&mdash;from this
on, here's where I look like a poor fish whenever
anybody outside of a motion-picture magnate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
or a theatrical manager makes a noise
like work to be done.</p>

<p>All the amateur stuff can be taken care of
by the sweet womanly women who ain't got
anybody to support except their dressmakers,
and not by a mere professional earning near
a hundred thousand a year like I. My final
lesson on working with volunteer boards and
committees is a un-wept memory, and believe
you me, that Chateau Terry battle had nothing
on some of the War Relief Committee
board rooms I seen in executive session and
keep the home fires burning is right, we done
it, especially the White Kittens Belgian Relief,
which it's a fact we nearly split over
whether we'd print our postcard appeals on
pink or yellow cards!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>Well, anyways, I suppose these relief committees
was a big help to them that was on
them if not to any one else, and after all a lot
of money somehow got left to do good with
after expenses was paid. But the biggest relief
I know of come from relieving ourselfs
of them relief committees, and the last of all
was the Welcome Home one.</p>

<p>I wouldn't of gone on it in the first place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
only I was so low in my mind. And who
wouldn't be a little low even with my cheery
disposition after such a morning as I went
through, first commencing with the loss of
Maude.</p>

<p>Not that I had ever liked her nor 'Frisco,
her husband, either, but losing her was worse
than living with her any day, and when Ma
come in and broke the news I wasn't in any
mood for it, struggling as I was over the joint
contract which Goldringer had just sent on
from Los Angeles as a nice surprise and welcome
for Jim which we were expecting to hear
he would be leaving France any day now. It
called for seventy-five thousand per each of
us for six joint pictures, our expenses to the
coast, and I was holding out for a car while
there and a special publicity man of our own
to be paid by them, but chosen by us, meaning
Rosco, which has so faithfully let the public
know every time I sneezed these last five
years and has a way of disguising a two column
ad so's the editor thinks it's a news item.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, I was reading through all
that foreign language portion of this contract
and had waded past about a page of "to wit,
viz.: party of the first part" stuff, which sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
like it didn't mean anything, but is where they
sometimes slip one over on you, when in come
Ma with a big home-made cruller partly in
her hand and partly in her face. She was
dreadfull agitated but had to get rid of the
first part of the second party before she could
speak, and I put in a few seconds of watchful
waiting, wondering how could she do it, for
Ma had put on at least thirty lbs. the last few
months and believe you me, she was no slif
before then, weighing some amount she would
never tell just what and anybody knows what
that means with a woman. But up to just
recent she had gone through spells where she
was making at least the faint motions of dieting,
or when not that, sighing and saying she
hadn't really ought to over every second helping
but taking it. Do you get me? You do!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>Since she had heard Jim was coming back,
however, she had taken to eating everything
in sight regardless. It give me real pleasure
to think of any mother-in-law feeling that way
about her daughter's husband and dancing
partner coming back, for with many mothers
it is nothing of the kind. So I made no remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
upon the cruller, and finally Ma give
a gulp and gasped out the bad news.</p>

<p>"Maude is gone!" she says.</p>

<p>"Gone?" says I. "Whatter you mean,
gone?"</p>

<p>"I can't find her no place!" says Ma. "And
I looked everywheres!"</p>

<p>This give me a most unpleasant feeling down
my back, and I got to my feet in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Are you sure she ain't hid?" I says, "like
the last time," I says.</p>

<p>"Come and see for yourself!" says Ma, and
I went, you can bet on that! And sure enough,
she wasn't in the box. Ma lifted the wire off
the top and lifted out the two old sofa cushions
we had put in for comfort and only
Maude's husband, 'Frisco, was there. He was
as usual lying in about five coils like a boiler-heater,
with his wicked-looking flat head on
the top, and he stuck out his oyster fork of
a tongue, and give us a little hiss, much as to
say, why was we always disturbing him. But
no Maude.</p>

<p>"Ma!" I began, catching a guilty look on
her face. "Ma Gilligan, you left that snake
out again! After all the times I ast you not
to!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it was just for a minute!" she says.
"I was playing with her, and then I thought
maybe the crullers I had made was cool by
then and I went and got a few and when I
come back she was gone!"</p>

<p>"Well, she's got to be found, that's all!" I
snapped. "All this comes from you insisting
on keeping in with them low circus people
and boarding their acts for them!"</p>

<p>"But Madame Estelle had to stay with her
husband when he fell offen the trapeze and
they so devoted!" says Ma. "And I didn't
take the big snakes&mdash;the substitute is using
them&mdash;but only her own dear pets which the
landlady wouldn't leave her have in her room."</p>

<p>"And now one of them is loose in <i>my</i> room!"
I says, "which is the general result of charity
which, as the poet says, had ought to begin
at home," I says. "And you know, Ma, how
I feel about snakes. There's nobody in the
psycopathic ward got anything on me. If
only they had even a few feet instead of so
many yards, I wouldn't mind them so much."</p>

<p>"Well, now Mary, I'm real sorry," says
Ma. "But not half so sorry as Madame Estelle
will be if anything happens to Maude!
I'm real fond of the little beauty myself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
if you had been with a circus all the years
I was, you would understand her better!"</p>

<p>Well, believe you me, it wasn't a lack of
understanding with me, it was a religious conviction,
and why not, for hadn't them beasts
made trouble beginning with the original eviction
of undesirable tenants, and was I to think
it likely that our own janitor would be any
more lenient if Maude was to get, say, as far
as the elevator? Keeping snakes never got a
tenant in right yet and loose ones might set
the first of May forward as many months as
was necessary. Not to mention my own personal
feelings in the matter, which it's a fact
I once broke a contract on the Small-Time
years ago because a snake-charmer come off
just as I was going on and I used to meet her
and them in the wings every time.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, I will say it for Ma, she
certainly turned in and helped me make a
thorough search for Maude, which was going
some for a lady of her figure. Looking for a
vanished snake in a apartment means considerable
gymnastics, because nothing can be
overlooked with safety, and I didn't want that
parlor-eel slipping anything over on me&mdash;especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
her cold stomach in the middle of
the night across my face, for instance.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>So I and Ma looked under all the furniture
and in the pedalcase of the pianola and in
the vases and behind the steam radiators, back
of the big gold clock, inside the victrola, under
the rugs, back of the pictures on the wall and
every place:&mdash;but no Maude. Finally we
even took a look out in the hall, although we
knew nobody had opened the front door, and
after that we opened the wall safe where we
keep our diamonds in a stocking, this being
a compromise between Ma's habits and my
common-sense. And then we had a peep into
the ice-box where Ma found a saucer of pudding
which she had someways overlooked at
supper but no snake.</p>

<p>And after we had felt under the bath-tub
with my best lavender umbrella which what
with the limousine it was the first use I ever
had for it, and then taken a forlorn hope into
the soiled-clothes hamper, we give it up, and
sat down with ruined georgette blouses and
perfectly wild looking hair and all heated up
like a couple of wrestlers. Any one coming
in then would of thought we had been indulging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
in a family discussion of some kind, and
for a matter of that it's the truth. I said a few
raw remarks about the kind of a home she
run for me and I working as hard as cider to
keep it and now she left snakes around, Gawd
knows where, and how would a artist like myself
get the rest to do justice to my work on
the bomb-explosion scene in the last reel of
"Bosh or Bolshevik?" which I was going to be
shot in only the next day, and if she had to
support me instead of I her, she would have
a right to leave any animals or minerals around
she chose, but this was my flat and although
Gawd knew she was welcome, pretty soon we
would have none if I was to be made a nervous
wreck out of instead of the biggest nerve in
pictures. Yes, I said that and a lot more
pretty mean stuff as only a daughter can&mdash;for
even with my refinement I am but a mere human
after all, and under the glittering success
of my career is several common human
failings and at times I act no different from
any less well-known female in the bosom of
my family.</p>

<p>So I had the last word and Ma was in wrong
and went to get lunch without a come-back
out of her. Alas! Had I but canned that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
foolish chatter of mine! But how could I know
she was going to act like she done later because
of it? You can't remember forwards and if a
person could, it's ten to one they'd quit before
they was off the bottle and go back to Heaven
whence they come, life being so full of mistakes
you could of avoided if only you had
done something different from what you did!</p>


<h3>                  II</h3>

<p>Well, anyways, Ma went back to the kitchen
to fix up a little snack of waffles and honey and
poached eggs on hash and cream-cake and
strawberries with a cup of cocoa and whipped
cream for a light lunch, her lunches being
light about the way a "light" motor truck is,
and I went back to my joint contract and was
so mad I concluded to write into it not alone
expenses and Rosco but a cottage or bungaloo,
as it is called in Los Angeles, while out
there. With which I wrote a refined but firm
letter to Goldringer, saying this was my final
word on the matter and spoke also for Jim.
Then I enclosed the contract and Ma called
out the cocoa was getting cold and so I stamped
and put it in the hall-slot which I never have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
a feeling any letter going down it is headed
for anybody except maybe the devil, and not
even him unless it don't get stuck on the way.
And then I ate, though not with much appetite,
what with expecting any moment to see Maude
crawl out from some place, and Ma being quiet
to a extent not to be fully accounted for by
three plates of waffles. It wasn't natural in
her, that quiet, but I remembered the doughnuts
and laid it to the sequence. Still I tried
to get her to talk, as talking, if about herself,
generally cheers her quite a lot.</p>

<p>"Anything ail you, Ma?" I says.</p>

<p>"Nothing much," says Ma, lighting into the
cream-cake. "Nothing to speak of."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it then!" I says. But Ma
wouldn't. She heaved a big sigh and handed
me a substitute for what was really on her
mind. It was something just as good, I credit
her for that.</p>

<p>"You know the stuff you ordered from
Schultz?" she says.</p>

<p>"You mean the wet goods I ordered to keep
Jim from parching to death this summer?" I
says, because although Jim is far from a real
drinking man, he having his profession of
dancing always in mind even after eleven P. M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and Gawd knows never fails to realize that
sound acrobatics is the basis of all good dancing
which a drunkard never yet was, or at least
not for over two seasons; still, in spite of all
this, Jim is a mere male and a drink or two,
especially if difficult to get, is not by any means
objectionable to him. And beside he had been
two years in France and I didn't want him to
feel it had anything on America when he
come home, even if I had to go so far as to
myself personally replace what Congress had
taken away. Do you get me? You do! And
I had done it as far as my bank account, cellarette
and the liquor-dealer permitted. Which
looked like it was going to postpone the
drought quite sometime for us. And while
here and there stuff like champagne and
brandy and vermouth had to be bought, like
remnants on a bargain counter&mdash;just kind of
odds and ends of each&mdash;I had one satisfaction
out of the buy, and that was getting a case
of Old Home Rye&mdash;absolutely the last case
in the city&mdash;probably the last in the whole
entire U. S. A., and it was Jim's one best bet.
A high-ball of this&mdash;just one&mdash;with his dinner
was about his exact idea of drinking, and I had
calculated that the three gallons, taking it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
his rate would last him pretty near a year, and
by that time some new vice would surely of
been invented to take its place.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>Well, anyways, I had ordered it and paid
for it, and there wasn't any more of it anywheres,
and it and the contract with Goldringer
was two of the best surprises I had for
Jim.</p>

<p>"Well," says Ma. "I can't say I approve
of the demon Rum coming into our&mdash;your
house, but once money is paid out, I like to
see the goods&mdash;<i>all</i> the goods, delivered," she
says.</p>

<p>"What's this leading up to?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To the way that man Schultz cheats you!"
says Ma. "He didn't send the Old Home
Rye!"</p>

<p>Believe you me, never have I been handed
a meaner deal than that, no, not even the night
Goldringer first heard of me and came to see
my try-out for the big time and my pink tights
didn't come.</p>

<p>"Ma!" says I. "Why don't you call him
up and find out why didn't he?"</p>

<p>"I've done that!" she says. "And he claims
on his oath it was sent with the rest. I spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
to the boy which brought it and then to Schultz
himself. They both claim they give it to
Rudie."</p>

<p>Rudie was the janitor but he had missed
his profession. He had ought to of been a
sleight-of-hand man, for he could make things
disappear in a way which would of delighted
a morning matinée audience, especially those
under twelve years of age. Believe you me,
though, he was never known to make anything
grow where nothing had been before&mdash;not rabbits
or even silk handkerchiefs, but it's the truth
that he had onct or twice caused a vanished
quart of cream to reappear if given a sufficiently
hard call quick enough after it was
missed. And the minute I heard he was cast
for a part in my tragedy, I decided to hear
him read his lines right off without no delay,
because it was practically impossible that he
could of got away with more than a quart yet
and I was prepared to go through the business
of believing him when he come to the
description of how he had dropped it by accident
and too bad but it broke.</p>

<p>Which was all right in theory, but Rudie did
nothing of the kind. Evidently so long as he
was lying he had made up his mind it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
as well to be killed for a case as a quart, as the
poet says, and when I sent for him and he had
kept me waiting while he sifted the ashes and
pounded on the steam pipes and talked to the
garbage man and got a light from the cop and
chatted with the elevator-girl and a few little
odds and ends like that just to show me where
I got off, he finally decided to come up. Well,
it was seven months to Xmas, so what could
I expect? Anyways, he finally made his entrance,
down R. C. to footlights, in my Louis-size
drawing-room, leaving tracks behind him
which Ma spotted with a angry eye as fast as
he laid them, and with all the well-known
courtesy of the proletariat he looked me in the
eye.</p>

<p>"Well?" he says.</p>

<p>"Say, Trotsky!" I says, for I had never
liked this bird, as he was on one continued
drunk. "Look here, Lenine," I says, glad of
the chance to insult him. "A case of fine
whisky at sixty dollars net seems to of been
avoidably detained in your dug-out. I expect
that with a little searching you can stumble on
it. And as for that bottle you broke by accident,
don't bother to mention it," I says, "because
I am gladly doing so for you," I says.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
"Only kindly find the rest and we will also forget
about this morning's cream."</p>

<p>Probably I hadn't ought to of been so generous,
for Rudie sort of swayed a little and
give me a pleasant childlike smile out of his
unshaved doormat of a face.</p>

<p>"Dunno wash you mean!" he says, real pleasant.</p>

<p>"Jim is right about the kick in that stuff,"
I says, eyeing him critically. "You certainly
have a swell bun!"</p>

<p>"Why, Mish La Tour!" says Rudie. "Don't
drink a dropsh! Never toush it."</p>

<p>And with that he give a sigh of disappointment
in me which made the place smell like a
bar-room!</p>

<p>"But of coush I'll shee if itsh down stairsh!"
he says.</p>

<p>Well, there was no use in arguing with him,
I could see that all right, all right, but I left
him know I wasn't swallowing any such a poor
alibi as his own word.</p>

<p>"All right, you second-hand shock absorber!"
I says. "Maybe I can't jolt the truth out
of you, but I will hand you one small piece of
information before you take your reluctant departure.
You'll find that whiskey or the cops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
will. And if they don't get me a judgment
against you, one will come from heaven, that's
a cinch, for you not only got the stuff, but
you took it off a returning soldier which is a
bigger crime than mere patriotic stealing would
be," I says. "You wait and see what'll happen
to you if you don't come across! We got
a long score to settle, we have, and right always
wins out in the end, and that's my middle
name!"</p>

<p>Well, he went away very proud and hurt to
think I would suspect him of such a crime, he
being that kind of a drunk. Do you get me?
Of course! Gosh! How I do hate to see a
person in liquor; really, I think prohibition will
be a good thing for all of us, and was myself
only storing up a little, for exceptional reasons.
And when a person begins talking about
federal prohibition and their constitutional
rights I can't help but wonder why they don't
consider it in the physical as well as the political
sense.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, it was a blow to lose that
Old Home, and awful irritating on top of
Maude. And then, while pulling myself into
one of these new accident-policy-destroying
narrow skirts which belongs with what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
through courtesy called my new walking suit,
the hall-girl brought the mail and Musette give
it to me in the midst of my negligee and struggles
and I stopped dead when I seen the first
letter, for it was marked "Soldier's Mail" and
only one which has some one expected home
and at the same time welcome, can know how
that particular mark thrills. Musette observed
me register joy so she registers it too, and I
tore open the envelope forgetting the skirt
which had a death-grip on my knees, and
opened up the page in Jim's dear handwriting.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>Did you ever come to a time in your life
where you had one trouble on top of another
until it seemed like nothing more could possibly
happen except maybe the end of the
world, and then something still worse was
pulled on you? You have! Well, this letter
was pretty near the end of the world to me&mdash;at
least a distinct postponement of anything
which could with any truth be called living.
For Jim wasn't coming back with the 70th after
all! As I read his words in that dear boyish
handwriting of his which he never had time
to learn to write better, being like myself quicker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
with his feet than hands, my eyes filled
with tears and I stumbled to the day-bed as
good as I could with the skirt, and sat down.
It seemed he had been put in charge of some
special work in Paris and it might be six
months before he'd get sent home! Six months!
And me getting all ready for a second honeymoon
inside of six weeks! And instead of being
out in the wholesome country with me at
Saratoga or Long Beach or Niagara Falls or
some place, he would be in Paris! That was
what I had to face and any woman will readily
understand my feelings.</p>

<p>Believe you me, I didn't care for Maude
or the Old Home or the contract or anything
for over three-quarters of a hour. And I had
to wash my face and powder my nose three
times after I was finally dressed on account
of breaking down again when just completed.</p>

<p>Whenever a person has a real sorrow come
to them the best way to do is control it quick
before it controls you. So after I had indulged
in the womanly weep which certainly
was coming to me, I braced up and got into
the new suit with the idea of taking as brisk a
walk as it would allow of. Then I put on a
new hat which I had intended for my second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
honeymoon but which would never see it or
him, as it would undoubtedly be out of style
by the time Europe had made up its mind one
way or another, and I was just going to leave
when the bell rung and Ma come in to say
it was a caller.</p>

<p>"It's that Mr. Mulvaney from the Welcome
Home Committee, the one that had you on the
'phone yesterday," says Ma. And after a minute
I kind of caught control of myself and says
well, all right, I would see him and went in.</p>

<p>Well, it sure is strange the birds they pick
out for these deeds of synthetic patriotism.
This one come from the neighborhood of Fourteenth
Street and must of got his appointment
of chief welcomer from the way he give the
glad hand. You would of thought he was
cranking a flivver that wouldn't crank the way
he kept on shaking after any real need was
past. And if he was to of greeted each of the
boys the way he done me, the army wouldn't
be demobilized in our generation! Also he had
a suit on him which spoke for itself and a
watch-chain which must of posed for them in
the cartoons of Capital&mdash;do you get me?
Sure! I and he had had a long talk on the
telephone as per above, and so as soon as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
left go his cinch on my hand, he got right down
to business.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss La Tour&mdash;er&mdash;it&mdash;er&mdash;gives
me great pleasure to think you will take charge
of the Theatrical Women's Division," he says.
"Er&mdash;I am a great admirer of yours&mdash;that
picture you done, 'Cleopatria,' now&mdash;great
stuff!"</p>

<p>Well, I let that pass, because how would
such a self important bird as this know my art
when he sees it, and if he enjoyed Theda, why
not leave him be? I changed the subject at
once for fear he would be confusing me with
Caruso next.</p>

<p>"And so I'm to spend ten thousand of the
hundred thousand iron-men raised by the Welcome
Committee?" I says hastily. "How nice.
What will it go for?"</p>

<p>"That is for you and your committee to decide,"
he says. "I'm sure you will think up
something tasty," he says. "And go to the
limit&mdash;we need ideas."</p>

<p>Well, anybody could see that. But I only
says all right.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are familiar with committees?"
says this human editorial-page-sketch.</p>

<p>"I'm never too familiar with anybody," I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
says stiffly. "But I have been acquainted with
more than one committee."</p>

<p>"Well, here are the papers I promised you&mdash;the general scheme and so forth. The central
committee will meet as is indicated here.
See you at them. Pleased to of seen you off
the screen! You certainly was fine in 'Shoulder
Arms'!"</p>

<p>And before I could get my breath he had
looked at a handsome watch no bigger than
a orange, humped into his coat and was off in
a shower of language that left me no come-back.</p>

<p>Believe you me, I was glad when he had
squoze out through our typical apartment hall
and the gilt elevator had snapped him up. For
to hand me ten thousand to spend on welcoming
a bunch of other women's husbands was, to
soft pedal it, rubbing it in. I was only about
as upset as that spilled milk that was cried over
and no wonder at 18 cents a qt. Well, anyways,
it was no light thing to face, going on
with this work and Jim's letter scarcely dry
from my tears. But having promised over the
telephone and being given no chance to refuse
in the parlour, I would keep my word if not my
heart from breaking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>Because, anyways, if I was simply to do
nothing to occupy myself except maybe a few
thousand feet of fillum and rehearsing my special
dance act for the Palatial and my morning
exercises and walking my five miles a day and
all that quiet home stuff which gives a person
too much time to think, what would I think,
except a lot of unprintable stuff about any administration
which was keeping him in a town
like Paris, France? And the only comfort I
could see in sight was to work hard to give the
boys that <i>was</i> coming a real welcome and remember
that Jim never was a skirt-hound&mdash;that
I ever saw.</p>


<h3>                 III</h3>

<p>Having reached this resolve I decided to go
on the walk I had mapped out anyways, because
what is home with a disappeared snake
in it? And so I started, and as I come past
the door in the lower hall, which its marked
"Superintendent," which is Riverside-Drivese
for Janitor, what would I hear but Rudie singing
to himself out of the fullness of his heart
or something.</p>

<p>I went out in wrath and the spring sun and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
after a while I begun to feel less sore and miserable
in my heart, partially because of the
fresh air and partially through irritation at
the stylish trouser-leg that both of mine was
in. But the day was too sweet for a person to
stay mad long. Ain't it remarkable the way
spring can creep into even a city and somehow
make it enchanted and your heart kind of
perk up and take notice&mdash;do you get me? You
do, or Gawd pity you! It's the light, I guess,
just the same as the audience holds hands when
they turn on the ambers with a circular drop
for a sunset or something.</p>

<p>And by the time I had walked along the
Avenue and seen all the decorations which was
already put up for the first regiments home,
I commenced getting real fired and excited
with my new job. It looked like the powdered-sugar
industry was going to suffer because
about all the plaster in the country seemed to
be being used on arches which looked like dago-wedding
cakes and you actually missed the
dolls dressed like brides and grooms off the top
of them. And here and there was some funny
looking columns of the same white stuff and
on the Public Library steps a bunch of spears
and shields was thrown all over the place just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
as if a big Shakespearian production had suddenly
give it up in despair and left their props
and hoofed it back to Broadway. It certainly
was imposing.</p>

<p>Up at 59th Street was a arch that looked
like Coney Island frozen solid. It was all of
little pieces of glass:&mdash;heavy glass and millions
of pieces. I don't know what good they
did, but they shone something grand, and must
of cost a terrible lot of money. I guessed the
boys would certainly feel proud to march under
it provided none of it fell on their heads.</p>

<p>Believe you me, by the time I got home my
head was full of imaginary architecture like
Luna Park and Atlantic City jumbled together
with a set I seen in "The Fall of Rome"
when we was shooting it at Yonkers. And
after I had squirmed out of my walking suit
and was a free woman once more, in a negligee,
which is French for kimona which is
Japanese for wrapper, well, anyways, I lay
in it and opened up the evening paper because
I am not one to let the news get ahead
on me and have acquired the habit of reading
it regular the same as my daily bath.</p>

<p>But it was hard to keep my attention on it
because Maude was still missing and also I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
kept thinking, when not of her, of the lovely
arches and so forth my ten thousand would
build. I had about settled on pink-stucco,
with real American beauties strung on it and a
pair of white kittens in plaster&mdash;symbol of the
best known Theatrical Ladies Association in
Broadway, and I expect the world&mdash;at the
top, when I opened the paper again and I see
something which set my mind thinking.</p>

<p>"70th will add thousands to ranks of unemployed."</p>

<p>Yes, that's just what it said. And I went
on and read the piece where it said how enough
men to start a real live city was being fed at
soup-kitchens and bread lines, not in Russia
or Berlin, but right in N. Y. C., N. Y., U. S.
A.! Somehow, coming right on top of all their
arches and so forth, it sort of struck me in the
pit of my stomach and give me the same sinking
sensation like a second helping of griddle-cakes
a hour later&mdash;you know! The thought
of all that money going on arches that after
they was once marched under was no good to
anybody but the ones which built them and the
ones which carted them away, had me worried.
Think of all the soup that glass and
plaster would of made! Do you get me? You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
do or you're a simp! And it also besides struck
me that while the incoming boys would undoubtedly
enjoy them city frostings, them
which had already marched under them and
was now in the bread-line must be kind
of fed up with it. Then I thought of the ten
thousand intrusted to me to spend which had
been gladly given in small sections by willing
citizens who wanted to do some little thing
to show appreciation to the boys which had
went over there, and I begun to realize I had
been told I could spend it anyways I wanted
to.</p>

<p>And when I thought of that pink arch and
roses I blushed, although nobody had, fortunately,
heard me mention it, except the two
fool dogs, aloud.</p>

<p>Believe you me, I then see like a bolt from
the blue, as the poet says, that arches was
all right in their way but they was in the traffic's
way at best and made mighty poor eating.
And so naturally with Ma having it continually
before me, I thought of ten thousand
dollars worth of eats, because while there is
quite a lot of red X canteens for men in uniform,
how about the poor birds which had just
got out of a uniform and not yet got into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
job? Besides there is something kind of un-permanent
about food unless a salary to get
more with follows it as a chaser.</p>

<p>And so I lay there in comfort all but for
the thought of Maude, and figured and figured
what would I do. It seemed it was a
cinch to get money from people to give the
boys a welcome but what to spend it on was
certainly a stiff one. But after a while I commenced
to get a idea. Which it's a fact I am
seldom long without one when needed which
together with my great natural talent is what
has made me the big success I am.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>Work! That was the welcome the boys
needed. Work and a little something substantial
to start on. So this is what I figured. Suppose
we was to divide up that ten thousand,
how many boys would it take care of, and
how?</p>

<p>Say we had ten men. A thousand each.
Too much, of course. Twenty men. Five
hundred per ea. Still too much. Well, then
forty men. Two fifty. Well, they could use it
of course, but it was not a constructive idea. It
was too much for a present and not enough
to invest. So how about 80. Well, that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
$125. per man. This was doing something
pretty good by eighty men that would very
likely need it, but it seemed sort of unfair not
to take in more of the boys. So I split it again
and had one hundred and sixty boys with
$62.50 in their pockets.</p>

<p>Well, I felt kind of good over this idea
and there was only two real troubles with it
which is to say that $31.25 for three hundred
and twenty boys looked nicer if there was
only some way to handle it right. But how?</p>

<p>I put in another hard think and then I got it.
The way to make that $31.25 a real present
was to make it a payment on something and
then with the other hand pass out a job at the
same time, which would not alone keep the
soldier but allow him to cover the difference.</p>

<p>And to get away with this all I needed now
was a popular investment and 320 perfectly
good steady jobs.</p>

<p>Well, with the Victory Loan the first part
was easy enough, and I concluded to pay
twenty-five dollars on each of three hundred
and twenty one hundred dollar victory notes,
making myself responsible for the lot the same
as if I was a bank and getting a job for each
note and having the giver of the job hold the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
note on the soldier and pay me the instalments
and I would pay myself back, or if not nobody
would be stung outside of me, supposing
any one of them failed to come across. I was
going to take a big lot for myself and another
ten didn't much matter.</p>

<p>And then with the remaining $6.25 each,
well, I would pool that for leaflets enough to go
around the whole division and on the leaflet I
would have printed the facts and a list of the
jobs and just what they was, with how much
kale per week went with them, and see that
the boys got them while the parade was forming
and then it would be up to them, because
the home folks can only do so much and then
it's up to the army their own selves just as
with munitions and sugar and red X work
while the big show was on. They did the work
but we gave them the job&mdash;we and the Germans.
And now all we could do again was to
give them a job&mdash;and it's enough, judging
from how they went after the first one.</p>

<p>And then, just as I come smack up against
the awful fact of where would I get them jobs
Ma come in and says the hot-dogs and liberty-cabbage
which it's the truth we always translate
them into American at our table, was getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
cold and as long as I was paying for them
I'd better eat them while they was fit. So
I says all right and we went in and did so.</p>

<p>Believe you me, it certainly is a remarkable
thing the way you start on a afternoon's work
like I done, all full of vigor and strength and
how your ideas and courage and everything will
sort of leak away toward the time to put on
the feed-bag at Evensong. And how again
the ideas and pep comes back in the evening
once you have eaten. There was almost perfect
silence the first few minutes we sat down
or would of been except for Ma taking her
tea out of the saucer, which I can't learn her
not to do and the only way I keep her from
disgracing me at the Ritz and etc., is to make
sure she don't order it. But when the first
pangs was attended to I commenced to feel
more conversational.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Work," I says, thinking of what I had
been thinking of. "Work is the one thing that
stands by a person. Everything else in life
can go bluey and their work will see them
through. That's why it's been so popular all
these years, and where these Bolsheviks make
their big mistake. Because they don't work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
and not working they get bored to death and
so they commence rioting. Do you remember
that quotation from that well-known cowboy
poet, Omaha Kiyim, "Satan will find business
still for idle hands to do?" How good
that applies to strikes&mdash;idle hands&mdash;ain't that
perfect? And it written so long ago!"</p>

<p>"How long?" says Ma.</p>

<p>"Oh, I dunno. Maybe three hundred
years," I says.</p>

<p>Ma laid down her knife and spoon, she being
quite entirely through, and looked me in
the eye.</p>

<p>"I will remember them words, daughter,"
she says very solemn.</p>

<p>And it's the truth I never noticed how serious
she was about it until I come to look
back on it nearly three weeks later.</p>


<h3>                 IV</h3>

<p>And during that time which has been so
immortally fixed in writing by the grandest
book with the same name, I was as busy as
the great American cootie is supposed to be
on his native hearth&mdash;only it ain't that piece
of furniture but another, of course. Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
get me? I'm afraid so! Well, I was as busy
as what you think. To begin with I called
a committee-meeting in the privacy of my
grey French enamel boudoir where I wear my
boudoir cap and have the day-bed hitched and
this committee meeting consisted entirely of
myself and the two fool dogs. And after I
had gone through all the motions, I appointed
myself a sub-committee of one to carry out
the meeting's resolutions and do all the work.</p>

<p>This is about what would of happened if
I had done it the regular way and asked Ruby
Roselle and Maison Rosabelle and the other
girls. We would of had a mahogany table
and a gavel and a pitcher of ice-water and a
lot of hot-air and a wasted morning and in
the end I would of been the goat anyways, so
I thought why not do it single-handed in the
first place and be done? I could print all their
names on the leaflets and they would be perfectly
satisfied.</p>

<p>So having got over the necessary formalities
as you might say, I accepted the nomination
and got to work. Fortunately I wasn't
doing anything except a solo dance at the
Palatial at supper-time and one picture. And
so I had most of my days to myself. The Fixings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
on the Avenue grew and blossomed and
so did my contribution to the Welcome Home
Committee. I didn't get to go to any of their
meetings but I don't imagine they even missed
me at the time. And while the arches and other
motion-picture scenery was being as completed
as they ever would be, so was my list. My
monument took up less space, but when you
gave it the once-over it seemed maybe a little
more rain-proof than the others. Apparently
all there was to it was slips of paper six by
eight with this printed on them. At the top
it says:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">"welcome home"<br />

"howdy boys, and our heartfelt thanks!<br />

do you need a job? here are three hundred<br />
and twenty and a victory note<br />

goes with every one!"</span></p>


<p>Then come the list. I will put down a part
of it so you can realize what a assortment of
things has to be done to keep the seive in civilization.</p>

<p>And etc, add affinities, as the Romans used
to say. And every one a real genuine job<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
paying good money. And getting them nailed
was no cinch, believe you me, except, of course,
I being such a prominent person I didn't have
as much trouble as some would of. Especially
where a firm was using my name on something,
they could hardly refuse me. I seen everybody
personally myself, and only the bosses
and in the end nobody had turned me down
except the one from which I had bought my
new bear-cat roadster for Jim's welcome home
present and it was <i>some</i> roadster, being neatly
finished in pale lavender with yellow running-gear
and a narrow red trim and tapestry upholstery
on the seats which was so low and
easy you involuntarily started to pull up the
blankets after you got settled. You know, the
kind of a car you have to look up from to see
which way the cop is waving.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, you would of thought the
bird which had sold it to me for cash money,
him being the manager of the luxurious car-corrall
himself, would offer to take on some
of the boys. But no, he says there was too many
auto salesmen in the world already, and that
they had ought to be diverted into selling some
of the new temperance drinks where their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
trained imagination would undoubtedly be of
great value.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, he was the only one turned
me down and I had the slips printed and
stored away in a couple of cretone hat-boxes
and commenced allotting the victory-note
pledges. And then I tripped over the fact that
I was a job short. There was the stuff all
printed, and a job too short and it the night
before the big parade! Well, I decided that
when the time come I would make the extra
job if I couldn't find it, and believe you me, I
was as wore out looking for them as a Ham
with his hair cut like a Greenwich village masterpiece.
Not that I ever saw one and I have
often wondered where the artists which drew
them that way, did.</p>

<p>But in the meantime I had got hold of the
Dahlia sisters, and Madame Broun and La
Estelle, and Queenie King and a lot of other
easy-lookers and had it all fixed for them to
be on hand below Fourteenth Street at ten
o'clock to give out the slips while the boys was
mobilizing or whatever they call it. And then
just as I was getting into the limousine with
Musette and the two cretone hat boxes full and
the two fool dogs and Ma, who would come up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
to me but Ruby Roselle with a new spring set
of sables which it is remarkable how she does
it in burlesque, still far be it from me to say
a word about any person, having been in the
theatrical world too long not to realize that it
is seldom as red as it is painted and that the
coating of black is only on the outside.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, up she comes from her new
flat which is only two doors from mine and a
awful mean look in those green eyes of hers
under a sixty dollar hat that looked it, while
mine cost seventy-five and looked fifteen, which
is far more refined only Ruby would never believe
that: which is one main difference between
her and I. And she stopped me with
one of those deadly sweet womanly smiles and
says in a voice all milk and honey and barbed
wire, she says:</p>

<p>"How's this, dearie, about the Theatrical
Ladies Committee," she says. "I only just
heard of it from Dottie Dahlia," she says.
"What was it made you leave me off?"</p>

<p>Well, seeing that the armistice was not yet
broken I felt I might let her distribute a few
leaflets, although I had left her name off the
signatures at the bottom on account of her
never having proved she wasn't a alien enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
to anything besides dramatic art, which hadn't
to be proved. So I handed her a string of
talk about this being a small affair and how
I had thought she would of been too busy to
do anything just now, which made her mad
because there is some talk on account of that
she wasn't working just then. But she took
a few leaflets and read the signature at the
bottom. "Theatrical Ladies' Welcome Committee"
and got real red in the face.</p>

<p>"Why, my friend Mr. Mulvaney spoke to
me about this!" she says. "I was to of been
treasurer, or something! Do you mean to say
you spent ten thousand dollars on <i>them!"</i> and
she pointed to the leaflets like a one-act small-time.</p>

<p>"Yep!" I says. "Take 'em home and try
'em on your piano!" I says. "But you will
have please to pardon me now. I got to beat
it!"</p>

<p>And with that I climbed in with the rest of
the family and we was rushed down town to
N. Y.'s Bohemian Quarter, where the 70th
Division was about to hang around waiting to
parade. Which it is certainly remarkable the
places the highly moral U. S. A. Government
picks out for her soldiers to wait about in say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
from Paris to Washington Square, and I think
their wives and sweethearts have stood for a
good deal of this sort of thing, to say nothing
of wives and sisters being kept from going
abroad. I don't know have any homes been
broken up this way, but I will say that Marsailles
and Harlem would of listened better
to the patiently waiting homebodies.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, down we went to the amateur
white lights, and by the time we reached
Twenty-Third we begun to run into bunches
of the boys. Bands was playing and all, and&mdash;oh
my Gawd, what's the use trying to tell
about it? There was plenty to tell, but ain't
every one <i>seen</i> it? If not at N. Y. C., why in
some town which may be more jay but with
its heart in the right place, and the heart is
the thing which counted this time as per usual.
Believe you me, mine was in my throat and so
was everybody elses when they seen them lean
brown boys with their grown-up faces!</p>

<p>Well, we stopped down to Eleventh and
Sixth and got out and commenced walking
around handing out the leaflets, and at first
they weren't taking 'em very seriously, but
pretty soon they began to get on to who I was
and of course that caught them and a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
many tucked the slips inside their tin hats
and all of them pretty near had seen me in
"The Kaiser's Killing" and I got pretty near
as big a ovation as I had tried to offer them.
And as for the parade they was very good-natured,
but it seemed to me that as usual the
stay-at-homes in the grandstands was getting
the best of it and the boys doing all the work,
for parading, no more than a first-class dancing
act, ain't quite the pleasure to the ones that does
it, that it is to them that only stands and waits,
as the saying is.</p>


<h3>                        V</h3>

<p>The crowds on the Avenue was something
fierce, and the only ones which had the right
of way, outside of officers and cops, was the
motion-picture men. I seen Ted Bearson, my
own camera man from the Goldringer Studios,
and Rosco, my publicity man, and they was
talking together. I stepped back in among
the boys, because I wasn't looking for any personal
publicity myself on this particular day,
wishing to leave all that to the division and I
knew that if Ted was to see me he would shoot
me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>But ain't it the truth that the modester a
public person like me is, the more attention
they attract? My sweet, quiet voice, silent
though snappy clothes, and retiring manner
have been in Sunday spreads and motion-picture
magazine articles practically all over the
world and America, and my refinement is my
best-known characteristic. Publicity is like
men. Leave 'em alone and they simply chase
you. Pretend you don't want them, and you
can't lose them. And the more reluctant I am
about being noticed, the wilder the papers get!
Only, of course, without a good publicity man
this wouldn't, perhaps, be a perfectly safe bet.</p>

<p>So this day, having got rid of all my leaflets,
I was slowly working my way toward the
Avenue, when publicity was thrust upon me.</p>

<p>You know this Bohemian part of New York
is made up of old houses which is so picturesque
through not having much plumbing and so
forth and heat being furnished principally by
the talk of the tenants on Bolshevism and etc.
These inconveniences makes a atmosphere of
freedom and all that and furnishes a district
where the shoe-clerk can go and be his true
self among the many wild, free spirits from
Chicago and all points west. Well, this neighborhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
could stand a lot of repairs, not alone
in the personal sense, but in a good many of
the buildings, but these are seldom made until
interfered with by the police or building departments.
And on the corner of the street
which I was now at there was a big old house
full of people who <i>did</i> something, I suppose,
and these were mostly bursting out through
the open windows or sitting on the little balconies
which looked like they couldn't hold a
flower pot and a pint of milk with any safety
much less a human. But there they was, sitting,
with all the indifference to fate, for which
they are so well known. I couldn't but notice
the risk they ran, but I should worry how many
radicals are killed, and so I paid but little
heed until I noticed that there was three little
kids&mdash;all ragged children of the dear proletariat&mdash;which
some of the Bohemians had
hauled up on a balcony which was too frail for
adults. The minute I see that balcony I was
scared to death, although the short-haired girl
and the long-haired man which was letting the
kids out on it was laughing and care-free as
you please. The kids got out all right, and then
something awful happened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>Right below was a open space at the head
of this particular column, where the officers and
color-bearers and etc was. Rosco and Ted
was getting a picture of them. But while I
generally watch a camera, this time I didn't
on account of watching the kids. And as I
looked that rotten old balcony broke and one
them, a little girl, fell through and hung there,
caught by her skirt, and it a ragged one at that.
Everybody screamed and yelled and sort of
drew back, which is the first way people act
at a horror before they begin to think. I
yelled myself, but I started toward her, because
the radicals couldn't reach her from
above and from below the ground was fully
twenty feet away and nothing but a fence with
spikes and a dummy window-ledge way to one
side. But I had a idea I might make it for
what with two generations on the center trapeze
and never a drop of liquor and not to mention
what I done in pictures, I think quicker
than some and act the same. But my new
skirt prevented, and ahead of me dashed a soldier.</p>

<p>In a minute he had scaled the wall and
worked his way along the spikes to that ledge,
and then while the crowd watched breathlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
he had that kid under one arm and was back
on the wall again. He held her close, turned
around, crouched down and then jumped. And
as he jumped I screamed and run forward, for
Oh My Gawd, it was Jim!</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I don't know how I got there, but when I
come to I and that scared kid was all mixed
up in his arms and the three of us crying to
beat the band which had struck up and the
crowd yelling like mad. And it was a peach
of a stunt, believe you me.</p>

<p>"Didn't you get my cable?" Jim says. And
I says no, and we clinched again. And then
we heard a funny, purring sound right behind
and broke loose and turned around and there
was that devil of a Ted taking a close-up!</p>

<p>"Hold it! Damn you, hold it another ten
feet!" yells Rosco, who was dancing around
like a regulation director, just back of Ted.
"Fine, Fine! Oh, boy, what a pair of smiles!
Say, folks, we shot the whole scene&mdash;<i>some</i>
News Weekly Feature. Oh say, can you see
me, Rosco, <i>the</i> publicity man!"</p>

<p>Honest to Gawd you would of thought he
had gone crazy! And that bone-headed crowd
couldn't make out was the whole thing staged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
or real. Believe you me, I had to pinch myself
to know was it real or not, but thank Gawd
it was, it was! And after nearly two years!
Do you know how that feels? Give a guess!
And then, just as I thought now this cruel
war and everything is over, why that roughneck
of a officer give the order to fall in and
of course Jim had to and left me there with
that kid in my arms for Ted to make a couple
of stills for the papers.</p>

<p>Believe you me, I couldn't tell how many he
took, or when, because seeing Jim so sudden
and unexpected had pretty near killed me, and
I couldn't say anything much about the parade
either, because something kept me from seeing
it and I guess it was my own glad tears. Anyways,
I had three wet handkerchiefs in my bag
when I got home and one of them a perfect
stranger's.</p>

<p>Well, of course, I expected the parade would
break up when it struck Harlem and the boys
would hurry right home. And did they? They
<i>did</i> not! I hurried right home, all right, all
right, but not so Jim. And for a long while
I was sitting there in one of my trousseau
dresses and a fearful state of mind over what
had he done to get killed since I last seen him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
But hours went by and still he didn't come.
And I didn't know his 'phone or where he was
or anything. The only clue I had that the
whole business was a fact and no dream was
the cable, which had come after he did, saying
he would be home as arranged after all.</p>

<p>Believe you me, I hope never to live through
another twenty-four hours like them that followed,
because I couldn't eat or sleep, not
knowing where he was.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Next morning I wouldn't even look at the
papers which was Sunday and full of our and
the division's pictures. And Monday was
worse, because even although Jim might be
alive none of the hospitals nor yet the morgue
had him, and so I commenced to think he had
gone back on me. A telegram come from the
coast saying "Great Sunday story bring Rosco
contract follows," but what did I care for that
stuff without Jim? Ma was very silent all this
time, and kept in her room a lot, with the door
shut. And then late Monday afternoon the
door-bell rung, and my heart leaped to my
feet like it had done at every tinkle for 48
hours, and I went myself, but it was only Ruby
Roselle and Mr. Mulvaney of the Welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Home Committee with her! The men that
girl knows! Well, she sees them in another
light than I and it's a good thing all tastes
don't run the same. But this was such a surprise
I asked them in before I thought and
pretty near forgot my own troubles for a
minute.</p>

<p>Ruby cuddled down into her kolinsky wrap
and give me the fish-eye, as she addressed me
in her own sweet way as a woman to her best
enemy.</p>

<p>"Dearie," she says, tucking in a imaginary
curl. "Dear, Johnnie here was over to my
flat and we got speaking of you by accident,
and he's anxious to know where's the money
he gave you, and why no decorations as was
intended?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss La Tour," says the old bird,
which it was plain she had made a even more
perfect fool of him than he had been before.
"Yes, Miss La Tour, it's a serious thing," he
says. "I understand you didn't really call
even one meeting and as for decorations&mdash;!!
Well, what can you tell us?"</p>

<p>Well, I told him how I come to think of
what I thought of, and the jobs which I had
319 of and the notes and all, and while I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
talked I could see plain enough that I was
getting in worse every minute, because they
had come determined to find me guilty, and no
matter what I said, it would of listened queer
with them two pairs of glassy eyes on me.</p>

<p>"I had a hunch," I wound up, "that maybe
something a little substantial would be welcome,"
I says, "because after all a person
can't live on plaster arches and paper flowers,
and three hundred and nineteen jobs ought to
take care of a considerable percent of the ones
that need it," I says. "And so while your
arches are all right," I says, "you must admit
they are principally for show."</p>

<p>When I got through Mr. Mulvaney cleared
his throat and didn't seem to know just how
to go on; but Ruby give him an eye, and so
he cleared his throat again and changed back
to her side.</p>

<p>"This is all <i>most</i> irregular," he says very
dignified. "Most irregular. You will certainly
have to appear before the general committee
and give them an accounting. What
you have done amounts to a misuse of public-funds!"</p>

<p>My Gawd, I nearly fainted at that! But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
before I could say a word a voice spoke up
from the doorway.</p>

<p>"Like hell it does!" says Jim, which that
dear kid had left himself in with his key and
listened to the whole business. "Like hell
it's a misuse!" he says, coming into the room
and putting his arm around me. "You just
let the public and the soldiers take their
choice! Give all the facts to all the newspapers
and we will furnish the photographs free! Go
to it! Get busy! And&mdash;get out!"</p>

<p>Well, they got, and what happened then I
will not go into because there are things even
a self-centered woman won't put on paper!
Poor Jim, and him back in camp to get deloused
and demobilized and his tooth-brush,
and a few parting words of appreciation and
etc, these past 48 hours which it seems is the
rule for all soldiers, and I suppose they did
need the rest after that parade before taking
up domestic life once more.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, that afternoon late, while
him and me was thoroughly enjoying our joint
contract and the Sunday spreads with our pictures
and all, in walks Ma with her hat and
dolman on and a suit-case in one hand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
'Frisco, the he-snake in his box, in the other
hand.</p>

<p>"For the love of Mike, Ma Gilligan, where
are you going to?" I says, looking at her idly.</p>

<p>"I'm leaving you forever!" says Ma, in a
deep voice.</p>

<p>"Leaving us? Whatter you mean, leaving
us?" I says, taking notice and my head off
Jim's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I'm going back to work," says Ma. "I'm
not going to be dependent on you no longer,"
she says, "nor a burden in my old age," she
says. "And now that you got Jim back I shall
only be in the way, so good-by, Gawd bless
you!"</p>

<p>"Why, Ma Gilligan!" I yells, jumping to
my feet. "How you talk! Besides what on
earth do you think you could do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I got a job," she flashes, proudly. "I'm
going back to the circus!"</p>

<p>Believe you me, that pretty near had me
floored.</p>

<p>"The circus!" I says. "What nonsense!
Why a trapezer has to be half your age to say
nothing of weight!"</p>

<p>"I'm not going on no trapeze at my years!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
says Ma. "I'm going back as Fat Lady. One
hundred a week and expenses!"</p>

<p>All of a sudden I realized the full meaning
of them doughnuts and cocoa and etc she had
eat these past months. She had been deliberately
training and as usual was successful. I
sprung to my feet and hung around Ma's neck
like a ten-year-old.</p>

<p>"Oh Ma!" I says. "Don't! Please don't go
back! Whatever would we do without you?"
I says. And Jim added his entreaties.</p>

<p>"Why, Ma Gilligan, what bally rot!" he
says, which it's quite noticeable the amount of
English he's picked up over there. "What
a silly ass you are, old dear!" he says. "Here
we are going to California and who would
cook for us if not you?" he says, "with the cook-question
like it is out there?"</p>

<p>Well, that weakened Ma considerable, for
cooking is her middle name. So she set down
the suit-case.</p>

<p>"Ma!" I begged her. "We <i>couldn't</i> have
too much of you, and you would never be in the
way or a burden no matter what the scales
say. For heaven's sake take off that hat, it's
too young for you, and burden us with the first
home cooking Jim has had in two years!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, she give in at that, and sat down the
snake and her dolman and pocket-book.</p>

<p>"Well, all right then!" she says. "I'll stay!"
Which is about all the emotion Ma ever shows.
"Whew, but it's hot in here!" she says and
turns to open the window and we left her do
it, because we seen she didn't want us to notice
her tears. And as she opened it she gives a
shriek and leans way over, grabbing at something.
And hardly had she yelled than from
below come a holler and a flow of language the
like of which I had never heard, no, not even
at the studio when something went wrong!
Then Ma commenced to laugh something
hysterical and pulled herself back in through
the window and leaned against the side of it,
hollering her head off.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I says.</p>

<p>"It's Maude!" gasps Ma. "She was shut
under the winder and when I opened it she fell
out and lit on Rudie's head which was sitting
right underneath."</p>

<p>Well, we could hardly hear her for the noise
in the kitchen. The dumb-waiter was buzzing
like all possessed. I and Jim rushed out and
there, lickety-split, come the dumb-waiter only
it was more inarticulate than dumb by then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
and on it the case of Old Home lacking only
three quarts.</p>

<p>"I find your whiskey, Miss La Tour!" says
Rudie's voice, very weak and shagy from below.
"I chust find him and send him right
away, quick!"</p>

<p>"Thanks old dear!" chortled Jim. "Come
up and have a drink on me!"</p>

<p>"No tanks!" yelled Rudie. "I'm leaving
this blace right now foreffer!"</p>

<p>Well, we should worry! I turned to Jim, a
big load off my mind.</p>

<p>"Jim," I says solemnly. "There is the three
hundred and twentieth job!"</p>
